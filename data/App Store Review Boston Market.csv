0,2020-12-20 12:20:36,Love the app but can‚Äôt sign up,False,T Davis 1991,"Boston market is one of my favorite restaurants. I am so glad that they came out with an app and they have updated it. But it has been six months since the last update, will you guys please update the app again, I am not able to sign up. Even though I agreed to the terms and conditions, the app will not allow me to sign up. Otherwise, I absolutely love this app. I look forward to using it, but for right now I will just use it as a guest until something is done about the sign up feature. Thank you",5,Boston Market
1,2019-08-22 23:31:54,"Excellent update, with one core issue.",False,Lux Iustorum,"In general, I have only high praise to offer for this application and the overhaul it recently received. The interface and navigating experiences have received a fresh coat of paint and optimizations, and it‚Äôs far more aesthetically pleasing to use than before.

However, I can‚Äôt offer further praise or feedback because I cannot successfully place a carry-out order with it ‚Äî at all. Once I complete my order and proceed to the checkout, hitting the last confirmation before my order is sent, I‚Äôm given an error message stating that ‚Äúno or invalid authentication was provided with this request‚Äù. Nothing I have tried appears to fix this, and I can‚Äôt see where the authentication measures are failing, or even where they are present. My payment method information was completely correct, I was on a registered account, and my restaurant wasn‚Äôt near close. I‚Äôm stumped, but hoping it‚Äôs fixed soon so I can earn rewards!",4,Boston Market
2,2021-10-21 09:09:19,Gift Card Doesn‚Äôt Work in App,False,CJ25INC.,"Months ago, I reviewed this app and requested a gift card option be provided in the payment method portion. The request was granted, but adding a gift card disallowed my order from being placed yesterday (it said something like ‚Äúyou must call the restaurant to place the order‚Äù), which negated the point of picking it up quicker. When I got to the restaurant and checked out, the lady told me the app and website don‚Äôt allow gift cards to be applied to orders. Luckily, she was able to manually type in my gift card number (it was a digital version), but what good is it to have a gift card payment option on the app if it doesn‚Äôt function properly? Please correct; otherwise, this is a smooth app to navigate. Thanks.",4,Boston Market
3,2019-12-06 02:10:07,Need NOTIFICATION BUTTON FOR CURBSIDE,False,QueeenJC,"Ordering through the app was pretty good. I am a visual person so I was happy there were pictures for every item. I decided to try the curbside feature instead of normal pickup. When I pulled up the the restaurant I sat there for about 10-15 minutes before just walking inside. An employee even walked outside to take a smoke break and just kept going like I wasn‚Äôt in the designated spot for curbside pick up. There needs to be a button or procedure that notifies the employees when someone is outside for an order. Not to be the ‚Äúlazy customer‚Äù who is just complaining about having to walk, I just feel like if the curbside feature is offered there should be some follow through... also the second time they have failed to give me a drink with my kids meal",3,Boston Market
4,2021-12-24 18:53:51,Terrible app /rewards earning,False,macmediausa,"After using this app for about a year now I finally decided to use some of my rewards that I THOUGHT I had.  Problem is that it was showing a zero balance and I was logged in correctly.  No record of my prior purchases.

Second, many times the app is not working very good so I go into the restaurant to order - which at times far faster than the app.   However if you don‚Äôt go thru the app, no way to earn rewards.

Lastly, the app allows you to order after hours - so if the restaurant closes early for one reason or another, you can still order and by the time you waste the driving to the restaurant, you find out it could have closed a couple of hours earlier.   Many other restaurant apps tell you if the restaurant is open or not and if you have a small time window to pick up.",1,Boston Market
5,2020-05-03 18:21:37,"Needs to take Apple Pay, problem with passwords",False,Joe-T,"This app requires you to set a password that is exactly 8 characters. Most password managers including the built-in Safari password manager on iOS auto-create passwords that are much longer than 8 characters. App needs to be more friendly to people who use password managers. 

All apps that accept payment need to take ApplePay. I‚Äôm tired of having to send my credit card information through to store in an app. This simply isn‚Äôt that secure. Too many apps lose data, and at least with ApplePay I know that Apple‚Äôs hardware encryption and trusted  APIs are managing my payment. It‚Äôs long past time for companies to get over their problems with contactless payments and to use the default one on their mobile device.",2,Boston Market
6,2021-08-19 00:55:51,Poor interface and bait and switch offers,False,JonathanBencosme8,"In there attempt to make the menu system simple they actually made it far more confusing then it needed to be, but I can forgive a poor UI. What I can‚Äôt forgive is the constant bait and switch offers, $3 pot pie sure sounds great, open the app and they have never heard of this offer. Great offers in the  notifications menu but imposible to redeem them in the app. If you dont write the coupon codes down they disappear when they are applicable. Rewards are nice and yes there are some exclusive menu items and an after dark menu but I‚Äôm sick of companies that make offers just to have you open the app and not follow through or make it so difficult to redeem that you just give up and decide to pickup some Popeyes‚Ä¶.hmm good idea think I‚Äôll do that.",1,Boston Market
7,2020-03-11 17:39:15,Best thing ever since sliced bread!,False,Mattrod9315,"I‚Äôm not joking.... this app is probably the best thing since sliced bread. You can order your favorite bowl or plate of food within seconds. The app is very simple and offers all the extra options like customizing your order the way you like it. I love adding gravy to my market bowl at the end and on top of everything and I added that in the notes. Guess what?! 
The gravy was on top just how I like it. Yeah it depends on the person who takes care of your order but that way Boston Market setup the app it‚Äôs made to be catered to us customers. Way to go!!!
It‚Äôs also very convenient for when you forget your card at home and they don‚Äôt have Apple Pay in the store yet so just other the food via phone and pay with Your phone.
You also get to use their point reward system!!!! Finally being rewarded to be a loyal customer!!!

Best thing since sliced bread and I mean it!üçû",5,Boston Market
8,2019-11-13 01:59:37,User friendly app and love the rewards,False,Ferrero J Man,"Loved using this app to order a dinner for my son‚Äôs cross country team. It saved me time from my busy schedule and I was able to order the dinner for 30 kids in less than 10 minutes. When I went to pick up my order everything was all set and the kids loved it. I will be using this app often. It makes my life easier and we love the food. Also, excited about the rewards I‚Äôm earning every time I use the app.",5,Boston Market
9,2020-10-12 22:21:47,Worst food app in history of history,False,Rayna in Tampa,"The point of an app is convenience. Having to re-enter orders 5-6 times to STILL not be able to place an order is ANYTHING but convenient. It asks you to enter your vehicle information endlessly, NEVER allowing you to move forward with order (this is third attempt at third visit since putting the app on phone). Of course employees don‚Äôt understand how to use app so I still have to wait in drive through line to place order. And, the promo codes it pushes to you aren‚Äôt recognized by the same app that pushes it to you. Such a joke and waste of my time! It motivates me to keep driving to one of the other establishments to eat that has apps which work seamlessly. Get it together man!!",1,Boston Market
10,2020-07-23 17:03:01,Reward Points System,False,Strolling2,"I don‚Äôt typically phone ahead when going to Boston Market so I need to key in my receipt information manually according to my server. However I do not find this process to be user friendly. First I have trouble finding the right page. Then, I am not allowed to key the information in on the same day of the visit. You have to key the information in a certain way or you get an error message. Then, after going through all of that, it still does not go through. This process needs to be greatly improved.",3,Boston Market
11,2019-11-20 15:21:55,Cannot get reward points,False,Sylvia Rhodes,"The new interface looks great. However, I have not been able to get the reward points for multiple transactions. Have tried contacting support, who responded with multiple curt messages asking me to refresh and reload my app, which did not work, instead of actually trying to figure out what the issue is with my account. Horrible customer service that has failed to fix a simple issue.",5,Boston Market
12,2020-08-18 17:33:44,Horrible.... rewards expire!!!!!,False,theclekticone,"I don‚Äôt leave reviews normally but this rewards app is horrible. Every time I get a reward ,it expires! Had a welcome reward, was about to claim it on the app, went to another app real quick to do something, came back and it disappeared! Said I had no reward to claim. Few weeks later, Had received my birthday reward for free dessert... said it it expired on the 18th of August, which means the 18th is the last day I can claim it....POOF!!! GONE!!!! Went to order food and claim my dessert & it wasn‚Äôt there. Not cool! They need to fix the reward claiming process. Other than, the app works well...but what‚Äôs the point if I can‚Äôt claim the reward that‚Äôs mine & that I‚Äôve earned. Thumbs down!",1,Boston Market
13,2019-09-20 14:36:50,Easy to use and beneficial,False,T21#,"This app is not only easy to navigate, but also gives the user the ability to order ahead as well as take advantage of the rewards program. I enjoy using this app to order ahead and my food will be ready by the time I get to the store. So far have been able to get several deals using the rewards program which is a great bonus for something I was buying anyways!",5,Boston Market
14,2020-08-17 20:02:22,Five Stars,False,MissionTinyHome,Honestly Boston Market is one of my favorite restaurants to order from because of its kind employees and great customer service and of course the amazing food!!! I live in a school bus and in the middle of making it a tiny home so Boston Market gives me the sense of a great home cooked meal after a long day of work. Sitting down at home with family.. it reminds me of home.,5,Boston Market
15,2018-04-11 23:50:54,"Great, but always room for improvement",False,GooieGreen,"So far, the app seems rather stable but the menu layout could use some revisions. The app looks rather plain and the ordering process can be a little cumbersome. There also seem to be some UI bugs that change the screen size.

Overall, the transaction was easy and once you get the hang of their ordering process, it is simple to use. Some minor tweaks could go a long way to make this a better app.",4,Boston Market
16,2020-03-11 23:27:37,"Curbside, don‚Äôt think so!",False,Jules1056,This is not the first time I‚Äôve ordered for curbside and had to go in to get my food since I waited 10 minutes after the time it said it would be ready. The food is good enough for fast food ‚Äúhome style‚Äù. The order was incorrect but tasted fine. The person behind the counter finally acknowledged my presence but was distracted by his earbuds. The food was ready but not brought to me. Yes I know this is totally a first world problem but don‚Äôt offer a service if you‚Äôre not going to provide it.,3,Boston Market
17,2018-10-09 21:27:52,Good food; most of the staff pleasant & helpful but not all.,False,IceBreaker2013,"I order on line and pick up for home consumption. The last 4 orders have included one of their full size desserts but for some reason the person fulfilling the order only put a slice in so I‚Äôve had to correct them each time.

In general they get it right and the food is very good. An individual meal can provide more than one serving which is perfect for someone living alone but who works on an on-call basis.",4,Boston Market
18,2018-08-26 18:41:05,Need a cancel order button!,False,JHun876,I placed an order on the app and accidentally pressed pickup instead of delivery. I called the store and they said to call doordash who could switch my order to delivery. The doordash rep said they can‚Äôt do that on their end but they were nice enough to call the store and try to resolve the issue. The Boston Market rep ended up having to call their IT department to cancel my order and I had to place a new order. All of this back and forth could have been easily resolved with a cancel order button.,3,Boston Market
19,2019-12-10 15:33:19,Where‚Äôs the beef?,False,ahsia ray ray,Uninstalling because the one thing that I would love to order online or through Grubhub you don‚Äôt even have on as an option which is the prime rib. Another problem is that you can‚Äôt get rewards if you walk in and order. I just spent almost $100 on 5 individual prime rib meals for my family because there‚Äôs no prime rib family meal offered and no rewards for in store pirchase...it all has to be ordered online.,4,Boston Market
20,2019-04-02 01:26:49,Best Restaurant app,False,PartyLiteAsh28,"I just used this for the first time and felt ordering was a breeze, menu items and additional options were easy to find and within 1 min of pulling into spot my food was brought out. If you allow the app to view your location they know exactly when you pull in. Loved this app far better than Papa Johns, Pizza Hut and others in their category!",5,Boston Market
21,2020-05-28 19:38:37,Fabulous Food Fast! Lots of Yummy Veggies!,False,Lizarddo,"Boston Market app is so easy and flexible. I prefer restaurants with good apps so I get exactly what I want without stress. 

The food options are very diverse, so I can order often and get different foods. Everything is tasty. Most restaurants have few vegetable options, so I always order extra from Boston Market to have with other foods. 

I found using delivery service is much faster than I can go to Boston Market, order my food and immediately come back. 

The rewards build up quickly and have great options for redeeming them. I think I will take the $20 off today with my rewards!",5,Boston Market
22,2020-06-16 06:23:15,Latest update eliminated the ability to pay with Gift Card in App,False,LiMyles,"The app is easy to use, until it comes to the payment.  The app no longer offers the ability to use a gift card for payment.  Neither does it allow the order to be processed in the app with an option for payment to be made upon arrival in store. Its poor judgement to eliminate this functionality during a pandemic. We are ordering in the app, to eliminate the need to enter the building to keep employees and customers safe.  We will avoid Boston Market during this time.",1,Boston Market
23,2019-11-16 23:52:50,No contact after ordering; Store was closed,False,Laura68,"I used the app today to order an early thanksgiving meal from the Tustin store for my mother to enjoy with our family. I received a confirmation email and my credit card was charged. When we called a bit before we arrived, we were informed that they were closed because they didn‚Äôt have water and that they didn‚Äôt receive our order. We went to another Boston Market (Costa Mesa) who assisted us with our order. Our lunch was an hour late and we were still charged for the first order..... so this app wasn‚Äôt so useful for me today.",1,Boston Market
24,2019-09-20 14:27:08,Easy ordering and good rewards,False,Km_221,"This is one of the easier to use online ordering apps I‚Äôve used, and I like that I can save my go-to orders and reorder them quickly. Boston Market‚Äôs rewards program is new, and I love it. I already got a free cookie, and I like that I can choose what reward I want rather than the restaurant deciding for me. (That‚Äôs my big issue with myPanera). I‚Äôm saving up for a free Pot Pie. :)",5,Boston Market
25,2020-06-27 22:56:52,Super Easy To Use,False,m4nb3ard,"Really surprised how well made the app is, the only thing that would be nice is a check in feature to notify the store that you have arrived for curbside pickup and an order status button (even if it was artificial just a timer would be nice). Otherwise the app was really excellent!",5,Boston Market
26,2020-10-04 16:01:23,What‚Äôs tasty to me,False,One finger slot,"The chicken is awesome. I haven‚Äôt tried many of the different sauces or meats, however the Mac and Cheese could use a little more work. The mixed veggies are awesome and the corn. The portion size is not to great for what is charged. The only reason I think people keep coming back is that the is healthy and flavorful. This is just my opinion",5,Boston Market
27,2020-05-01 23:57:05,Great app that works wonderfully,False,KiyoKarina,"Everything works under control, except the delivery driver didn‚Äôt ring the bell when he/she delivered the food on the doorstep. I didn‚Äôt even noticed whether he/she came to our doorstep. lol. But, I liked how he/she left the food on the doorstep to avoid the contact, due to COVID-19.

Have followed their instructions to log out, wait 5 minutes, log back in.  No points after waiting 4 days to log back in.  Attempted to contact BM through different avenues, absolutely no response.

Entered DOB incorrectly, app will not allow oneself to edit.  Reached out for help, they replied that they had edited, but have not, still the same and never received birthday reward.

29,2020-05-04 17:28:32,Easy & Quick!,False,NiCkYsKiNy,To say it simply it‚Äôs easy! App is easy to use & delivery is always quick! Points build up when you use the app which allows you to get free food & at a time when $$ is super tight a night of feeding my family goes a long way!,5,Boston Market
30,2021-01-02 08:11:19,Ridiculous app,False,Calimomoftwins,"This app allows you to order food for delivery. However, if you only receive half your order, good luck trying to reach them about it. The restaurant doesn‚Äôt answer their phone, and there‚Äôs no where on the app to report issues. If you choose ‚Äúcontact us‚Äù, it takes you online to create an account. But I have an account, let me sign in. Sign in, then click ‚Äúcontact us‚Äù, takes you back to create an account. An endless circle and cheated out of half my order.",1,Boston Market
31,2020-11-12 14:13:51,It could be great,False,Kevin Inertia,I‚Äôm not interested in knocking the app but if you want to make it better look at the chipotle app. You should have a barcode to help keep track of rewards. If the cashier doesn‚Äôt ask when you check out ( and they don‚Äôt) you have to remind them. Hopefully they‚Äôll get it right but that is doubtful. Youre  missing a big opportunity here. Time to get it right.,3,Boston Market

Went to the restaurant and was informed they never received my order. Had to reorder while there and my total was $3 less in store, than online for the same thing? Eventually the online charge was credited to my account. Tried ordering through the App a second time and it keeps crashing on me. Usually never write reviews, so that says something about this App.",1,Boston Market
33,2020-03-07 13:14:56,Great rewards!,False,Tbone8210,Boston Market rewards program is better than others because you can redeem points for either free food or just get $10 or $20 off orders.  A lot of options unlike others that just give you one choice.,5,Boston Market

The special instructions box is so character limited it‚Äôs pointless. Then if you try to pay, you‚Äôll randomly get errors like the pay sum is different than the total even though the app calculates both and you have zero say.

The fastest I could get an order complete it with asked asap, 20 minutes. I arrived after the time it said my order should be ready. Not only was it not ready, but they told me it needed to be prepared and the wait staff was very rude. There was no skip the line option. And then I waited over 20 minutes for them to prepare it.

There is no record in their system for the order and no way to get a refund. Currently still waiting if someone will return my call to assist, but as of now, I am out of the money and left to suffer.

I thought this was an error no they respond to me and explain it‚Äôs done on purpose for deliver orders like door dash. I did a take out order and was infuriated when they didn‚Äôt have it ready and didn‚Äôt have items I paid for. What‚Äôs worse is they would only reimburse me the items value for the in store price.
