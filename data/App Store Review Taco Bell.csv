Also now you can select sauces, the workers don’t always look at the receipt for sauces, but it’s still early for the changes still and I’m sure some people might change there mind. Thanks for the awesome update. Great step forward!

Update: Finally got access to my account again after 9 weeks of not being able to get in. Only after writing the Beware on my review. So I had a week turn around on getting my account access back after giving a bad review.

Beware: I have been locked out of my account for 2 months now. Trying to get back in to it to no avail. I try the forgot password and it won’t send me the email, yet they continually send me promotional emails. I had 2 rewards, but by now they are probably expired. The contact form for support never appears to work, for me at least. I don’t get a confirmation that I submitted a support ticket or any notifications that I will be contacted. I can’t resign up with Facebook or my email because they are both already being used. So, as I have said to support. I’m not buying anymore Taco Bell until I can have access to my account. I had all my favorites set up and I was happy. Now, my disappointment is immeasurable and my rest of the year has been ruined.",2020-12-09 22:27:09,Taco Bell

I submitted  the order over thirty minutes before arriving to the location because I made a stop prior to arriving.  The money for my order was taken from my account and when I got to the window I was yelled at and told that I could not have my food (that I had paid for) that they didn’t see any order or money. They yelled at me and made me leave the drive thru. They told me they have nothing to do with the “raggedy” app. I left and went down the road to call the customer service number for a resolution . The rep answers the phone sounding sleepy and  nonchalant. She told me there was nothing she could do. It was the apps fault . That I have to wait 3 business days before I can be refunded. I called again today , Tuesday ! And was told that a refund has been requested that now I need to wait 6-10 business days for the app to refund me! I will never use this App again in my life .

2,"Way, way better now. Solid app.",,4,Argembarger,False,"I wrote a snarky review about how much the app would lock up, and how buggy the checkout process was. I’m really glad to see that the new version of the app is *far* superior on both fronts!

I still have to knock a star off for the fact that certain screens—especially the Customize screens—can appear to fail when you open them. They are actually just loading, and dutifully populate the views after they’re done, but they are not reporting any status or progress and it makes it feel like the app is frozen or has hit an error, which isn’t great.

Also, this is just an opinion, but I think it’s odd that ordering for in-store pickup indicates that they start preparing the order right away, but ordering for drive-thru indicates that they wait for me to be on-site and check in before the order is prepared. It seems like I’d always want to choose in-store pickup, so they can prepare it while I’m driving there, or at least have advance notice of the order to save a little time on both sides, and I’m confused why the drive-thru doesn’t use the same logic... Maybe the higher likelihood of being forced to wait for a long drive-thru line...? Only one transaction-spot to receive the food in the drive-thru, versus potentially multiple points in-store? I assume it was a deliberate choice. Just interesting, I guess. Other apps use GPS to detect when you’re nearly at the restaurant for that kind of thing, could be a good feature.",2019-05-27 19:09:22,Taco Bell

I like being able to pay contactless when I eat out nowadays and also have the convenance of having it ready to pick up. The app was already buggy while trying to add items and once I got to checkout it decided to give me an error message as soon as it took my Apple Pay stating “sorry something went wrong...” BUT STILL CHARGED MY CARD with no order placed or history of a order placed ( I called to make sure that the location I was trying to place pick up did or did not receive any order under my name). This is ridiculous and an overall terrible experience. They make it so difficult to even find where / how contact the support. Luckily after some googling I was able to get hopefully somewhere via sending an email. Their number is only available from 8am-4pm what about “after hours” as most people eat dinner after 6pm or 7pm! Plus I saw the wide spread issue discussed that I am having with having your card charged without an order placed or being able to pick up the food you paid for. I will be uninstalling the app / not be using the app + suggesting that others do the same. Waste of your time and money. Also an additional side note why the did you take away all the things people actually enjoyed eating from Taco Bell with weak overhyped replacements. The fiesta potatoes + pico de gallo were literally one of the reasons I went to Taco Bell instead of Del Taco.,2021-02-02 03:02:57,Taco Bell

In order to make the purchase, it makes me then re-enter my card info then it works. I have to do this every time. After while, I end up with my card info in there 10 times and have to go through and delete them. The other issue I have had is with getting locked out. It tells me it’s time to change my password. It asks me to click a link to send me an email to update my password. Even though my email is correct in there and I receive all the rewards/marketing emails, I never receive the link to reset my password. Now I can’t even use the app anymore at all to make purchases or access my rewards. I have tried to go into the app to use the contact messaging features and have asked for either a phone call or email follow up. No surprise, I never receive a call or email in regard to getting assistance with my issues. Of course, the app is third party and no one in any of the locations, including managers can assist or give me any phone number to contact for assistance.

I waited in a 30 minute line twice both times because the service was slow and I didn't find out that it wasn't at that location until I was at the window. That's 2 hours of waiting overall for a taco! If it wasn't too late to have gone inside to get it but at that point only the drive thru was open. The third time I tried using it wasn't as bad but I like jalepenos so I tried adding them to my order and the option was there but every time I tried selecting it, it either didn't even show that I tried adding them but every now and then it would show it checked off for a split second before unchecking itself, I tried it with multiple different food items to make sure it wasn't just that my item couldn't have jalepenos added to it. It wouldn't let me add it to a single item. And I can't find any explanation for it. This app is supposed to make ordering easier but it's done nothing but add 10 times more stress to trying to get food. The restaurants weren't at all helpful when I explained the situation.

As a result, despite the store no longer offering a limited item on the menu, they still offer it in the app. I figured: maybe it’s just an incentive from ordering from the app? Not that it matters, b.c I hate how every fast food restaurant wants you to preload your payment methods. Still, I got taco bell gift cards recently, so I decided to order their cravings box. This particular limited item is only available through the app. I decided I’d preload my gift cards onto the app to try to get this item; unfortunately, the app wouldn’t even accept my order submission. The store I went to most definitely took online orders, but it seems their system likes to act up. It was already annoying that they made the item only accessible through the app, but when their system decides ‘go to the next taco bell to get this item instead’, I may as well just uninstall the app from my phone at this rate, and spare myself the inconvenience. Thus, that’s what I’ll do. Seriously, considering all of the above, what the heck is it good for? Compared to all of the restaurants with apps, this one seems to be among the most meaningless ones to have… Taco bell had literal years to win me over with the app, and I genuinely wanted them to; regrettably, it’s just an outright disappointment I refuse to entertain any further.",2021-06-19 22:03:05,Taco Bell

II,False,"Let me start by saying I have used many different apps through the App Store for food services and restaurants. This app, by far, has caused me the most headache for trying to figure out what I want to eat. The first thing that happens when opening the app is it displays an error message stating “Oops! Well this is embarrassing...” the message goes on for longer. It leaves me with a button to go to the home page. I press the button and does just that. At the home page, or menu as it takes me to, if I click on any category of food so I can figure out what I want to eat, it displays the same error and takes me back to the menu. The only way I can get to see the menu is the top slide bar with the categories. By the time I figure out what I want, I could have ordered at the drive-thru and paid. Since I have been experiencing this flaw since installing, I have never used the app to order food. Other apps have given me such great results and streamlined the ordering process, unfortunately, this app is an inconvenience. I truly refuse to use the app as I have been having many issues. If this is how a more personalized experience feels then it is a disgrace to have this app anywhere near my phone. Two stars for a review is being generous.

Original: This app is fantastic... until it kicks you off and won’t let you back on. I guess I was using it too frequently! Seriously though, the app is attractive, user friendly, and dangerous for late night cravings. However, on trying to order one night from the same store I had used it for many times before, upon checkout/submit order it told me that the connection with store was lost. I thought this to be a mistake so I tried again, and again, and again. I was starting to get nervous that maybe my order was going through and just getting run over and over. But that was not the case. Using Apple Pay, none went through but what was worse, it logged me out of the app, I couldn’t remember my password, and then the forget password functionality told me user access denied. I can’t get back into the app... I’m in the phantom zone! Taco Bell is easily losing $15/wk keeping me out of the app. Please fix this bug!!!",2018-08-13 01:57:18,Taco Bell
9,"Updated, the app is great now!",,5,abelcf16,False,"Unfortunately there’s no way to give this app zero stars, or I would. Had the app a couple years ago, and was triple charged on the app for a $50ish order, then reassured that two of the charges would be refunded. Didn’t happen until extensive phone calls were made, so I deleted the app, no big deal. I figured, as a year or so went by, the bugs would be worked out, and got the app again last year. Couldn’t log into my account, or even create a new account. Deleted again. Today, I decided to try it again. Surprise surprise. Can’t log into or create an account, and now the app won’t even allow me to select a location to start. If I’m the only one, then awesome. Keep up the hard work, but if this is a common occurrence, why even have the app available to the public? Hope this review helps, and best wishes to the developers!

Update: I decided to give the app another shot today. It worked great for us this time so I wanted to be fair and not leave the rating at one star. Developers, whatever you did, great work! Please keep it up, as we look forward to continuing its use. Thank you!",2020-07-05 20:52:50,Taco Bell

I arrive more than 15 min after the charge hit my credit card. No order. No food. An employee tells me I need to log into my account to show her the order. I showed her the app. It does not ask for a password or name, just email, phone and credit card.  Only the email can be used but a password is needed. The manager tells me I cannot get food because I have no receipt and I cannot get a refund because I ordered through the app and not his store. I have to take it up with customer support. Fine.

I go to the register and repeat my order to the woman at the register, she stops me and tells me one of the meals I ordered doesn’t exist. In the app, for this particular store, there was a meal containing 2 chalupa supremes, a taco and a drink. So I asked about it again as it is also offered on Taco Bell’s website.

First, my past orders never show up in the past orders section. Second, I often order the same things with the same modifications. I have saved these items as favorites, but they never appear under my favorites section. But when I try to add them as a favorite again, I’m told it’s already a favorites item. So instead of making it easier on me, I have to go through the hassle of adding the same modifications every single time. Third, it saves my card info without asking me if I want it to save. And if the card info is already saved, it will still save it as a new card...so the same card is listened multiple times. I don’t want my card info saved at all so I always have to go in and delete them.

This is very disappointing, especially since some people have been locked out of their accounts for weeks, even months. I hope this does not happen for myself or for others from this point on, but if it is occurring (which if it’s happening to me then it’s likely happening to others) often then I will not be using the app any longer, which is unfortunate because I often utilize everything from the favorites to the notifications for deals as well as the rewards (ESPECIALLY THE REWARDS!!)

14,Useful but not always reliable,,4,Buckeyenut33,False,"First, the app isn't optimized for iPhone 6 or 7 plus models and the widescreen resolution is kinda annoying. Second, submitting an order vs. ""checking in"" at the pickup location don't always sync well. It tells you to wait until you arrive, but there's often 10+ min delay between my check-in time and when the order finally queues at the restaurant. Kinda defeats the purpose of the app's supposed convenience and time-saving abilities lol. Third, there is nowhere in-app to add special instructions or requests for the order (i.e. extra sour cream on the side). You have to make those requests at the restaurant, but adding a simple instruction at TB is like asking them to perform brain surgery. And when you tell them you want the extra items on the side (which you already paid for in-app) 99% of the time they charge me AGAIN at the window. Lastly, the app should decrease the odds of TB screwing up the order since I'm placing it myself and making sure it's correct. And yet they NEVER get it correct lol don't seem to have this issue at other restaurant apps (chipotle, subway, etc.) & I've tried at numerous TB locations, so it's super frustrating.

When I questioned one manager about the app, he said, “I didn’t even know we had an app” — I guess corporate needs to work on pushing out information to their stores and franchisees.  Another frustration is that when you try to choose a pick up time, you have to choose an option in 15 minute increments.  So, usually, I will be 5 minutes late or 10 minutes early to a location.  Then, it seems that they don’t make the food until you get there and talk to someone, so what is the point of ordering ahead?  I also don’t like that you have to choose your pickup method before you get to the store. So, if I choose drive-thru and then arrive at the store and there are 15 cars in the drive-thru line, I am stuck. So far, only the McDonald’s app lets you choose when you get to the store.

We’ve never had issues with wrong orders before so checking the order didn’t cross our minds. Unfortunately when we got home and pulled all of the food out we were missing two desserts and all of our sauces we asked for. I checked the receipt to see if I made a mistake when I placed the order online since it’d been my first time using the app, and everything was correct on the receipt. We didn’t want to make the drive back to the store and wait in line again, so we just took the loss. Even better, when we finally started eating, I figured out the steak quesarito wasn’t even made right with the ingredients that was listed on the app. I was hungry so I ate it anyways.. with no sauce. I’m not saying I won’t go back, it’s just that Taco Bell has never disappointed this Taco Belle before. I’m not sure if the items were overlooked or if there is something confusing that just happens with the online/APP orders or what.

And you can’t go in and fix the order in the cart, it won’t let you save. You have to go in and delete each custom item and then add them back again. It’s best to add everything to the cart first then do customizations, but this has been a bug for a long time and should have already been resolved. Also, I created custom favorited items to help easily put in an allergy friendly order but the same or similar bug happens: it says it’s customized under favorites but when added to the cart, all changes are erased. Big problem for picky eaters and people with food allergies who may not know that happens. My paranoia at having a reaction making me triple check is the only reason I’ve caught the app wiping my changes. It makes what should be a simple experience more complex and frustrating.

Something I really don’t like about the Taco Bell app is that it doesn’t have the Limited menu items on their app for example “Nacho Fries.” It’s not even located in the “New” category which if it’s not a regular menu item it should be in there at least. Also another thing I don’t like about Taco Bell is that if you order in person or in drive-thru there’s no way to upload your missed transactions for Taco Bell rewards you’re only rewarded points for ordering in the Taco Bell app. Which I have no problem ordering through the app I prefer it however if you don’t have what people want to eat on the app like the “Nacho Fries,” there’s no point ordering through the app. It would be a lot better if Taco Bell found a way where you could upload your receipt on their app for missed reward points just the same as Chick-fil-A does.

Then to make it even better when you use the app to order it always seems the stores flip out if you have a “big order” and they make you feel bad about it and you have to pull around and wait. You can hear the employees yelling and complaining and it’s a very uncomfortable experience. Something needs to be done within the app constantly crashing and the way customers are being treated for just simply placing orders on the app. I shouldn’t have to feel bad for placing a larger order for everyone in my family an modifying some of the toppings and they still not make it properly and I have to drive back.

I used to love this app when it first came out, especially when it had all the great offers. On July 8th though I used this app to place an almost $32 order and when my husband arrived to pick up the food on his way home from work, the cashier at the store told him there was no record of his order. I figured no problem, it was placed recently he'll just show the receipt in the app or the email receipt we received and they'll make the food, right? Wrong! They refused to give us any food and said we would need to pay again. The manager was not apologetic at all and said the charge would drop off in a few days automatically. Fast forward through 2 emails to customer service, 1 phone call to customer service, and finally filing a dispute with my credit card company. I finally received an email from customer service yesterday saying they are refunding the money, but to wait 3-4 days for it to process. The worst part in all of this communication we have received 0 apologies from Taco Bell and obviously 0 food. 13 days later and I am still waiting for them to fully process our money back.

I was hoping the glitches would get fixed, so it would be more reliable. However, it suddenly stopped working completely - won’t let me log in, won’t let me reset my password, I’m totally locked out.

However, this app and TBell as a company has gone to complete crap. I had ALL notifications turned OFF inside the app and it still shoves pop advertisements on my phone homescreen from out of nowhere. Boooo. 
Now for the real reason your quality has plummeted: the food and service is terrible. The time estimate and “your food is ready for pickup” is ALWAYS wrong. I end up waiting and extra 10-15 minutes after the app says the food is ready and sometimes I have to ask if they have even started making my order. Four different locations in the CA Bay Area have all gotten my food order wrong about 95% of the time we order anything. Even as simple as not including the correct items, or forgetting items entirely. It happens so often that I’m not surprised in the least when I have to go back to the counter and ask “hey where’s my taco AND burrito???” 
It’s not like these are complicated orders, only 5-6 items total. And I get it, it’s cheap fast food and I shouldn’t expect much. But come on, my new expectation is that Taco Bell will mess up from the start, waste time, and I’ll leave disappointed again.

Like myself ,I don’t like the refried beans or the sour cream. So I usually remove them and add black beans and guacamole. But then when I pick it up and get home and look at the product it ends up having sour cream and refried beans after I paid extra for add-ons that I wanted.  and I know it’s not all the stores and I know it’s not all the employees. Maybe somehow on the screen that the employee is looking at if anything is removed or anything added would be lit up in different colors. Maybe it’s already that way I don’t know.

Most infuriating, the favorites section that should allow you to save items with customizations will only sometimes remember those customizations. More often then not, you’ll add an item to your order from the favorites menu and have to go through the whole customization process all over again to make the item how you want it.
Then, if you manage to get the app to open and load the menu (which is very difficult and usually takes several tries even on a gigabit-class internet connection), get your items in the cart, customize them how many ever times it takes to get the options to stick, and get to the checkout, you’ll be lucky to be able to select whether you’re eating in or going through the drive thru. 
Oh, and heaven help you if you need to order your food for a little later because it causes the whole checkout screen to refresh if you select any other time then right now.

Take some time to give attention to detail before rushing out a new version. 
Literally takes 4 seconds for the app to process and load that one of the categories at the top was clicked now. 4 seconds for the bottom tabs as well. 2 seconds to swipe back and forth between the food menus.

Those categories at the top doesn’t support fluent-motion movement. Instead, they move in “pages” but you can tell it was designed for fluid-motion. When you’re navigating the “pages”, it’s cutting off half the name for “Online Exclusives”, “Burritos”, “Specialties”, “Groups”, and “New Cravings Value Menu”.

You can’t swipe from the left side of the screen to go back. You can’t swipe right to open the right-side menus when they are there. (You can swipe items in the checkout, so that functionality is already used, just not integrated.)

The “home” tab at the bottom features outdated deals.

There’s a point and reward system, but you can’t look at the rewards until you unlock them or look under “how it works”.

Recently, when you select to reorder a previous order, it does not save any of the customizations when it previously did. When you make customizations, the app adds several copies of the meal to your bag. The most recent issue is all the locations nearby have been delisted from the app, however it shows an error of “this store is closing soon” despite the store not having any reduced hours and is open as normal. If the delisting is from supply issues the app should reflect that. Occasionally (about once a week sometimes multiple time a week) the app will lock you out completely. It will show “the app is busy” and a 5 minute timer starts. This usually lasts 1+ hours. This app has also double charged me and customer support is not helpful asking me for information that is all on file through the app. This app has taken a significant downturn from the update a few months ago. They should roll back the update until they figure it out. Usually companies can iron out issues like this pretty quick but it seems to keep getting worse.",2022-01-09 03:31:28,Taco Bell

While the concept was good, it takes so long to load that it makes it annoying. When trying to customize an order, I’d rather see the words than the pictures if it means the app won’t crash. It shouldn’t take 15 minutes to place an order for a #8 combo with no lettuce. You have to individually click on the item you want changed for each item in the combo- which I understand the logic for, but it increases the likelihood that the app will crash each time.

Then once you finally get it placed, the restaurants don’t seem to know what to do. Many problematic experiences at every location we tried.

Also, when trying to save a customized order for a combo, it will say customized - but those edits disappear from the instructions to the restaurant it’s being sent. This mistake can only be seen when I click on the item to review it at checkout. That pretty much makes the “favorite” function useless. Not to mention that those “favorite” items disappear randomly from my account from one week to the next.

If you like all the menu items exactly the way they are normally made, then this app shouldn’t be too bad. But if you want extra sauce, or no sour cream,..., you need to have patience.

The app worked perfectly for the first time, even the “favorites” feature! I’m impressed by how quickly these issues were fixed. Thanks.",2019-06-22 05:14:00,Taco Bell

I like ordering online with apps because it makes things easier but in this case it just made everything more difficult.

I told them to keep looking and then after some time they said they found it and asked if we got drinks and what they were.. What’s the point of ordering our drinks on the app if they have no clue what they are when we get there. I ended up just asking for cups and getting the drinks myself (after having to call home and check what everyone wanted). There was awful communication with this app and the store I went to.

I wasn’t aware of the app until I saw an ad for the free chalupa box, but I guess this has been around for a couple of years actually??

The rewards system is pretty cool. And I’m excited to start earning rewards!

My main problem with this app is the payment methods. I’ve tried to connect a gift card to my account and it says the card doesn’t exist. I even connected this card to my account via the website, yet it still wouldn’t work or load up on the app. Also whenever I try to connect a credit card it pops up with an error message and kicks me out.

I also wish the app was more user friendly. It was slightly inconvenient that I really couldn’t find my way around the app. I was just kind of confused about how to order and how the rewards program works. However, I did eventually find the “how it works” tab.

One other small bug I’ve found is favoriting menu items. I’ve favorited some items like the grilled cheese burrito and the quesarito, but the favorites tab says I haven’t favorited anything yet. I go back to favorite those menu items again, and the app tells me I’ve already favorited the item. Again, nothing big but still slightly inconvenient.

The one thing that was really disappointing was the basically nonexistent special offers, deals and coupons. I frequently use nearly every fast food chains apps, and I’m given offers for every chain. Some are pretty good such as Subway you can gain token points for each purchase and after you reach 200 you get $2 off and up and they email you coupons for free sides or special deals. Others like McDonald’s offers are honestly amazing that have multiple coupons every single day!

I have Been using the app for several months and it was great…until one day I got locked out and can not get back in. Similar to the other review seems to be a major issue. The forgot password link never sends the email although I still get promotion emails. Including the one to tell me to use my reward before it expires. Zero app support.  Only way through email is to say you had an issue with a visit…and then it wants the location. Very frustrating. Finally found a phone number for them to put in a ticket.

I presented her with the application pulled up on my phone and she confirmed my correct location, but could not confirm they have received the order.

While I can order and somewhere the system has all my points and rewards, I cannot see my points when I go to the rewards app.  I also can never redeem any rewards since this tab does not work properly.  I have dealt with this at least since October 2020, and it’s now almost June 2021.

After waiting in line behind 3 cars we pulled back through to another no record...after an argument about my card already being charge (30 minutes after we placed the order) the order conveniently “popped” up....i wont be ordering from taco bell again, but if you are, id suggest just doing the old fashion drive thru order - its 30 minutes quicker.

It seems like the app has two tabs on the order menu (Groups and Value Menu) which both show the same items (those being the offerings for Groups, such as taco and burrito packs), and this leads me to believe that either this is an app error or that all value items have been removed from the menu.

128,"No rewards, only shows fraction of menu",,1,BallisticsGirl,False,"I downloaded the app for the rewards... To be honest there’s no rewards; at least not anymore.
 The app also doesn’t show the entire menu, so if you want to buy current new things like meal deals or their newest products they don’t show it, or it’s so hidden you don’t find it.
 You also can’t tell them you want stuff on the side like red sauce, sour cream etc. It’s not an option. Also used to be able to tell the store you were pulling into the parking lot or were close by so they could start making your order... That no longer happens either. Additionally if you pick a drink and it’s a fountain drink then you have to wait to get there to tell them what it is. 

Last time, it took them half an hour to make my order because they refused to make it until I arrived. They regularly forget stuff so always triple check your orders. 

Not the most reliable, I’ve definitely seen better. If you want to partially customize your order, then do it here but know you won’t get your order early, you’re not jumping the line (if there is one), and triple check everything.

Thirdly and this is the biggest issue I have with the app... you can’t pay in store. You HAVE to pay in the app. Every other app I have gives me the option to pay when I arrive to pick up my family’s meal. This doesn’t.

1. Customization. I can customize just about any item, swapping the protein, adding extra of a topping, adding a nonincluded topping, or removing a topping! It also shows the price for each add-on. 

You can also add sporks, napkins, straws, lids, and an unlimited amount of mild, hot, and fire sauces! 

2. User-Friendliness. The app is easy to use and navigate, with intuitive menu items and navigation features. It offers ready time and options to cancel an order if necessary. Well done! 

3. Multiple Payment Options. I can check out with a credit card, save gift cards, apply split payments, or use Apple Pay.

4. Sophisticated Graphics. You can tell a lot of thought and effort went into building this app. It’s also great on visuals so you can see exactly what you’re ordering.  

5. Rewards. Rewards. Rewards. Every 3rd visit I have already accumulated a reward, which is awesome! The Nacho Bell Grande, priced at more than $5 is the best value reward for spending $20. They also offer occasional rewards, double points, or other promotions to try new and hot items.

Updated review:

Help!  I’m hungry!  I added items to the Taco Bell app. I chose this method because I want to customize my items (and not try to tell it to the drive up speaker). Got to checkout. No matter what credit card I use, it won’t go through. So I tried online, even signing up for Visa Pay. But no, my payment method won’t go through. I wanted Taco Bell food. But evidently Taco Bell wants me to go to McDonalds. 

End of Update

I like using the app to order because of the ease of adding or removing ingredients.  I know that it will be made how I want it. 

Several ways to pay are offered. It's easy to use.  I'd recommend this app if you love Taco Bell.",2019-03-28 03:40:39,Taco Bell

Two things:

One:
I should be able to order more than one type of an item. I wanted two beef chalupas and my son wanted two steak chalupas. The shopping cart just adds more of what was already in it. There is no way to check in the cart if the order was correct. After much consternation, I figured it would end up being four steak chalupas even though I had attempted to order two beef and two steak. I was correct when the order was picked up, it was four steak chalupas. This is silly. App developers, I know you’ve had a stressful year, but, c’mon. 

Two:
I was happy a few orders ago to figure out the “favorites” so I could avoid the usual tedium of the app. But when I attempted to order our favorite, I noticed the order included Fiesta Potatoes. Fiesta potatoes are no longer on the menu. Since the order was a “favorite” there was no way to modify it in the shopping cart. Really? Please make a “favorite” amendable in the cart!!

It asks me to update my password and/or signs me out too often which is frustrating cause I have to go through this process when I just want to order my food. So, basically, ordering food on the app has become a chore. I’m to the point where if it doesn’t work the first time I say “screw it” and I just don’t go.

On two different accounts now, the Taco Bell app has forcibly barred me from placing orders to any restaurants. I can at least access the menu and my favorites, but when I go to check out, the error always says “no pickup times available, please select another store.”

Three problems with this: A) that’s complete nonsense, the store is open and accepting orders, B) I get this error before I can ever select whether I want it inside or drive-thru, and C) this error is present for ANY AND EVERY restaurant I select.
I can’t place orders any more and there’s ZERO reason why! It would make sense if the store were actually closed, but I know from previous experience that I *can* place online orders to stores that are unexpectedly closed!
The ONLY thing I’ve seen that fixes it entirely is to create a new account. I only have so many email addresses, which means inevitably I will be locked out entirely.

I get to the restaurant it is still being made so I sit at the restaurant and wait for several minutes. Eventually I go up to the counter and ask them about my order and although it says my food is being made, there is no sign of it on there and as far as receiving my order! There was no way to cancel the order like they usually have that option and my credit card had already been charged!So I had my husband at home doing an online order it through the computer since it looks like the app order is still in limbo.

It also sometimes doubles your order on the order history page, so it appears as if you accidentally placed two orders even in the middle of your current one.

Now, as for their rewards program?
It’s trash compared to other food chains. 
I’m just being honest lol
I can get AWESOME food rewards with Wendy’s or SONIC Drive-In’s apps. Taco Bell’s is simplified to medium drinks & their basic menu items like a crunchy taco unless you unlock “fire”, which by the way, requires you to spend an insane amount of money for something better than the basics.

Will be placing this next part on Yelp as well:
My local chain (Huntingdon, TN) has only been open about a month & a half now, & during the first few weeks, they were doing AWESOME.
The food was hot, it was all put together very neatly (not just slapped together), & it hadn’t been sitting under a heat lamp for a few hours. 

Recently, they’ve been slacking.
Food is a mess when you open it. Toppings coming all out of the tacos, chalupa shell is rock hard & cold, etc. Do BETTER!!
Y’all charge quite a bit more for your food compared to other chains, so if you want REPEAT CUSTOMERS, I suggest you change this!",2021-07-31 00:05:31,Taco Bell

I ordered to pick my food up in store. Once I got there, this particular store only accepted drive thru & delivery. The app should have stated that. The drivethru was super long and they were super slow. I tried to wait, but it was just too long of a wait. I tried to find the option to cancel.... guess what no option to cancel no where in the app! Looked for the number to the store to call and cancel, no number provided in the app 😣 I googled the number and I still couldn’t reach anyone. I tried to contact taco bell customer service and it only gave me an option to email them. So somebody got some free food because I didn’t pick it up and couldn’t cancel it smh.

Secondly there are many glitches in the app, it can be very slow at times when trying to add items to your order. Then if a Taco Bell store does not have an item it will notify you that the store has something unavailable and I pressed the “remove items from cart” button and it never removed anything, therefore preventing me from ever placing my order.

There is no way this is a 4 star app. Today I tried to order lunch but upon arrival the store said it could not make the meal because they had no chicken. They also said there was nothing they could do to refund me my money and to contact my bank. This is truly pathetic!

Update:  Well I love the food at Taco Bell, but this app experience along with the service you get at Taco Bell when things go wonky with it has cost Taco Bell a long time customer.

To me the only good thing about the app is being able to customize your order so at least you know it's right when you order it. Now whether they actually make it right is a different story.
