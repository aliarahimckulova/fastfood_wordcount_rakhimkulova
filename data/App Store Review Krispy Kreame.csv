0,Love Krispy Kreme,False,5,I love Krispy Kreme Doughnuts but the location in Charlottesville Va is having problems every single time I go in or drive up. Last week I ordered a chocolate covered cream filled and a banana cream. Got to the they were having a problem make Banana cream. 3rd time I have tried to get that one. Got on the road and my chocolate cream filled was custard filled. Called the location cause that happens a lot. Did not answer their phone. Yesterday not enough help for the buy one dozen get one for 1.00 had a problem ringing the deal. Said the rewards thing was down. Twice the glaze machine was not working. Ugh I give up,2018-07-28 13:51:44,i give up on this location,Krispy Kreme
1,App Doesn‚Äôt Work When Registering For Rewards Program,False,1,"Installed the app and tried signing up for the Rewards Program. Enter my info and get a message that I already created an account (I did?). Select the Forgot Password link and get an e-mail with a 4-digit pin. Type the pin in, and get an error that the pin # can‚Äôt be found. Request new pin, get new pin, type it in: same error. Went through it 3 times without success. There is no customer service link or contact to follow up with, so I think I‚Äôm done trying.

UPDATE:
Tried to give this app a second chance. Again, I was told that I already had an account (I do not). Tried a bunch of my commonly-used passwords and none of them worked. So, I tried the password recovery option and was given a screen to input a 4-digit PIN that was being sent to my e-mail. I exit the app, check my e-mail, get the pin, and go back into the app to type it in (takes maybe 5 seconds max)... and the app has reset to its home screen! I can‚Äôt get back to the PIN input screen, so I try again and... in order to get to the PIN input screen, I have to request a new PIN (the ‚Äúold‚Äù one sent 30 seconds earlier no longer works). Yet I can‚Äôt exit the app to check my e-mail because it will loop back to the home screen every time I do so. Sensing another endless loop of futility was beginning, I quit trying. How am I supposed to input the PIN when the app goes back to the home screen EVERY time you exit it?!?",2019-04-03 14:55:48,'93 Bruin,Krispy Kreme
2,An awful app experience,False,1,"I don‚Äôt usually write app reviews but this app genuinely infuriates me. 
Trying to sign in fails constantly. I have no idea why. I used Sign In with Apple but it insisted that it couldn‚Äôt work. So I try create an account normally. But of course Apple doesn‚Äôt remember the keychain generated password it recommended so tha didn‚Äôt help. (Less the apps fault but still annoying) After a while it some how works I literally did nothing different. I go in and try to place an order because there‚Äôs a deal going on. I select my store but as a try to order it insists that the one store that is close to me has no donuts. It instead show coffee under the donuts tab and Merchandise under the coffee tab. I tried reopening the app thinking it was another bad glitch. But nothing worked and eventually the sign in issue came back. I just wanted donuts on sale man. I check the website to try and order but apparently it‚Äôs the same issue No donuts. Weird right? A hot and ready sign yet no donuts. No donuts at a donut shop. I‚Äôm losing my mind at this point and I decide to check at another store. Would you look at that! They have donuts! And everything you could ask for. So why doesn‚Äôt it work for my store? Who knows because there is now way to ask for help in the app. Also the other store is way too far away. Just my luck.",2021-12-12 22:53:49,Levi_Romo,Krispy Kreme
3,App Broke,False,2,"We Love the doughnuts‚Ä¶ but your app bites! I logged in using saved password on keychain. I tried manually entering info, I deleted and reinstalled the app, powered off my iPhone and restarted. I stood on one foot and made an antenna from foil‚Ä¶ ( ok I didn‚Äôt do that one, but you get the drift.) it says the credentials are invalid, it won‚Äôt send me a verification. It will not let me make a new account with same email because apparently it‚Äôs only useless when you try to make a different account. I tried to login from FB and it says it‚Äôs unavailable‚Ä¶ someone out there in donut land does not want me to order donuts‚Ä¶ so‚Ä¶ When you fix the app‚Ä¶ we‚Äôll get donuts! ( at least our new years resolutions are safe until whenever your IT people figure out how to make the app work. ( btw I‚Äôm on iPhone iOS 15.3.1 Also.. my birthday was Jan 15‚Ä¶ and I did not get my birthday donuts! Maybe at least the app will work soon?!?!? It‚Äôd be awesome if something went right this year! Thanks for letting me vent‚Ä¶",2022-02-21 01:00:05,Infoang,Krispy Kreme
4,Good but,False,1,Ok so I love your doughnuts so I asked my mom if she could Order some and she said yes so she ordered and she ordered herself two doughnuts and we went there and she didn‚Äôt get her doughnuts that she Deserves because she works so hard she doesn‚Äôt have a job because my grandma and grandpa and one of my uncles and my grandma goes to work and my uncle my uncle drives himself so work and my grandpa drives my grandma to work and my mommy has to clean feed me play with me cook food feed my pets take care of our foster puppies I‚Äôm public home schooled so she had to log me on every day almost and she doesn‚Äôt even get 2 dumb doughnuts give and last time she ordered she didn‚Äôt get her doughnut treat my mom good you mean brats I can‚Äôt believe I like you stupid doughnuts I should go to dunking doughnuts or somewhere else that treats my mom hood oh and you‚Äôre so expensive it‚Äôs 25 dumb dollars to order doughnuts and 13 dollars to go on the store how awfully mean you are to people I love my mom your brats I hate you,2021-09-27 17:43:50,poopsscoops,Krispy Kreme
5,Can‚Äôt place orders,False,2,"There‚Äôs a menu, which shows all their products, and tells you all about them, but doesn‚Äôt let you place an order. The only thing you can actually do with the app, is pay for your purchase at a Krispy Kreme Store, if the store has the scanner, and it works. To do this, you have to enter your credit card information, manually, because it won‚Äôt scan your card. Then you have to transfer funds from your card to the app. Then when the cashier rings up your order, you hold your phone under the store‚Äôs scanner, and it takes the money. It keeps track of your purchases, so you can collect rewards. Once you load money from your credit onto the app, you can‚Äôt get it back out. You can only use it to buy doughnuts, and only if the store has the scanner. Instead of making purchasing their products easier, the app makes it more complicated. Sort of defeats the purpose.",2019-01-18 16:00:09,Bykr Bayb,Krispy Kreme
6,Horrible,False,1,"We came and there were no doughnuts except the pink and chocolate sprinkles. We were going to get kreme doughnuts but then so random stupid person came and took all of them. There was a coupon in the app that said buy a dozen and get another glazed dozen free. We were going to get that but then it didn't go through. We asked for the manager and see of he could do something, but the worker said ‚Äùthe local manager couldn't do anything‚Äù. The worker didn't do anything, acted like he didn't care, and kept on pretending to act like he cared by saying ‚Äùsorry‚Äù. To top off this horrible event I scanned my app 5 times to get the rewards the worker even said: ‚Äùok, it scanned‚Äù. However, on the receipt, it doesn't have my app name(so it didn't scan) and I didn't get the rewards. Never trust the workers, the Krispy Kreme app, and the Krispy Kreme store. Never coming back again, the app offers are fake news, I'm telling everyone I know( which is a lot of people) to never go again.ü§¨üò°üç©ü§Æ",2019-01-27 23:58:48,Zeina Taha12345,Krispy Kreme
7,Fails every time,False,1,"This app has a fatal bug.  I‚Äôd give it zero stars if I could.  When I try to sign in, it says my credentials are invalid.  When I try to reset my password, it says I previously signed in with Facebook.  When I try to sign in with Facebook, it says it can‚Äôt find my account.  This is an endless circle, and I am not able to log in on the app or website.  I tried contacting them through their contact form, but it always makes me include a store location (even though this error is not tied to a specific store).  A phone call led me through a series of voice messages and never to a live person, and there also was no chat box.  Sometime later, after leaving a comment to who knows who, they sent a coupon in the mail with no return address so that I could write back.  It is for a free doughnut for my troubles, but they never addressed the problem!  I still cannot log in anywhere.",2021-03-09 11:10:20,Grzzh45-8,Krispy Kreme
8,"App does not credit reliably, in midst of a time-wasting adjustment",False,2,"I liked the app at first as I thought it would keep track of my points but it doesn‚Äôt track purchases reliably. Even worse, recently I purchased points in-store and was charged 3 times but the points never credited so I had to go back to my credit card company and initiate a time-wasting complaint, I‚Äôll end up spending an hour on it to get my money back. This is the absolute worst thing that can happen with an app, 2 stars are only for my early experience. Don‚Äôt try to credit in-store with this app (or wherever WiFi is spotty), if you want to add points, do it when you have a reliable WiFi connection well before going there.  In addition, some of the newer store employees have a lot of trouble using the app to take payment and have to call their manager over.",2022-01-04 12:53:21,Idle Expat,Krispy Kreme
9,Rewards Issue,False,1,"I filled out the information for the Rewards Program and I noticed I want given an option to put my birthday. I called the number, but it was giving me all types of options other than to talk to a Customer Representative for the app or anything. So, I emailed them and was given an apology about people not receiving their points. I made sure to be clear and concise when explaining my issue and was given an irrelevant reason. I ended waiting about 6 days to see if they at least changed it for me or would contact me back, but nothing. I emailed them again and it's been 6 more days and no response. Very unprofessional on their part and clearly they do not care about others. It seems silly to be upset about this, but I have been extremely patient about this and the whole experience has deter me from ever going to any Krispy Kreme or products as a first time consumer of the brand.",2021-01-23 07:26:12,ommgnivkyname,Krispy Kreme
10,Good,False,4,"I personally think it‚Äôs a really good app you get great rewards for shopping there. If you don‚Äôt shop there very often or aren‚Äôt willing to go you most likely won‚Äôt like this app. If you don‚Äôt go regularly or even once a month you don‚Äôt get many rewards you will get a couple of coupons and maybe even a free donut but that‚Äôs about it. If you are a regular or you come once a month and you use your app when they scan, you earn points and then you get things like a free donut or a free dozen and if you save your points you can even get free keurig coffee things that go in them... which may I say they are REALLY GOOD!!! So if I where you and I went to Krispy cream often I would totally get his app you will save so much money and you won‚Äôt regret it. üëç",2018-05-31 22:29:58,Haley-N-S,Krispy Kreme
11,Waiting for a fix!,False,1,"Just as everyone else having issues after this forced update over the weekend, I can‚Äôt log into my old account that had over 4,000 points! I spent several hours trying to reset the password until I saw all the recent reviews and realized that the problem wasn‚Äôt on my end, so I left it alone patiently waiting for a fix. I know my points are OK for now when I tried using my registered phone number in a store, but I have no control over how my points are being applied - the system is trying to give me ‚Äúfree stuff‚Äù arbitrarily and not when I wanted to redeem the points, like in the past. Very frustrating! The old app worked like a charm and the new rewards system is not better in any way.

Please fix this problem and send out an update confirming the issue is being resolved, so people stop wasting their time and getting frustrated for no reason!",2018-09-05 19:49:18,Rina25,Krispy Kreme
12,App Issues,False,2,"I ordered on the app with 2 different different cards, & my my money was withdrawn from both accounts without actually completing my order. I contacted my local Krispy Kreme (the worker was extremely nice), but they did not see my order in store. I was given a 800 number to call, but unfortunately COVID-19 has customer service hours only for a short period of time during the week and Saturday's. I‚Äôm not upset with Krispy Kreme as a company, but it‚Äôs very frustrating to have the ease of using an app, only to realize the app withdrew money from my card without processing my order. Now I have to wait until customer service opens at 9am cst on Saturday just to prove to customer service that I made 2 purchases and never received what I ordered. It‚Äôs safe to say that I won‚Äôt be using the app again!",2020-07-18 01:10:27,Colem020,Krispy Kreme
13,Consistent App Problems,False,1,"The app mostly never works - it has only worked once out of the many times I have tried to use it.  Whenever I login and start an order, the screen is always just blank and none of their donuts show up.  The only thing on the screen is to click ‚Äúdonuts‚Äù or ‚Äúcoffees and drinks,‚Äù but there are never any donuts or coffees and drinks to click and order.  As I said before, just a blank white page.  This is a consistent problem - the app is just terrible which is unfortunate because they advertise such great deals, such as free delivery on any order.  I‚Äôm not one to write reviews, but this is getting ridiculous.  Why have an app in the first place if it isn‚Äôt going to work?  Also, it is not just me who has this problem, I‚Äôve asked others about it and they have the same awful experience.",2021-12-12 18:55:56,growing very frustrated,Krispy Kreme
14,The worst platform compared to competitors,False,1,"Too many software bugs and customer support sounds uninterested, Ill-informed, and unwilling to help. Had a error with entering card info, and the app ended up charging me twice. Called to get the amount credit back. Rep said the request was sent but couldn‚Äôt give a confirmation number or TAT OR ANYTHING to let me know the request was actually sent. Called back 3 business days later, new rep tells me there‚Äôs no request open for me; tell her about the initial conversation, she turns the whole story around  ‚Äúwell if she said she sent it, the it‚Äôs there. We don‚Äôt  have confirmation numbers or email correspondence but something like this takes about 5 business days.‚Äù üôÑ okay but you just said you didn‚Äôt a case open with my registered email... once I get my money back Krispy Kreme has lost my business FOREVER.",2019-03-05 16:08:26,Kitty2k,Krispy Kreme
15,Logs Me Out,False,3,"I love Krispy Kreme but the app isn‚Äôt working for me. It said I already had an account with my email but I never made one and when I tried to reset the password through email I didn‚Äôt receive one. I made a new account w/ a different email this time it didn‚Äôt ask me to input my birthday and on my profile it says to call a number to change the birthday. I don‚Äôt want to call just to put in my birthday, I‚Äôm not even trying to change it - just put it in for the first time. After that it logged me out and now the app closes when I press ‚Äòlog in‚Äô and I have to either make yet another account or just delete it. Please help KK I really would love to have the app.",2020-12-17 03:54:52,morganleeco137,Krispy Kreme
16,Love Krispy Kreme but y‚Äôall need to work on your delivery system,False,2,"I love their donuts, they‚Äôre the best; but I have issues with you guys‚Äô delivery system. A week ago I ordered a dozen donuts for delivery. They took the money out with the quickness, but cancelled my order no sooner I placed it. Turns out it was an issue with their system & my order was never sent to the store. So I instantly wanted my refund. Well I‚Äôve emailed them multiple times, I even called them yesterday & I STILL haven‚Äôt heard back from them! It‚Äôs been a whole week at this point, I want my money back! Your app is good when it comes to making a pick up order, but idk what you‚Äôre trying to pull with that delivery stunt y‚Äôall pulled. & why hasn‚Äôt anyone gotten back to me about my refund? Fix your delivery system.",2020-03-10 14:54:17,PoisonIvyTheParamoreLover,Krispy Kreme
17,Free doughnut,False,1,How do you get the free doughnut for downloading app ? I don't see a message or a link to send messages. The card seemed like fun until I started reading the negative reviews. I probably just old and slow at figuring out the app üòú. I suppose the best option is to physically walk in the store and interact verbally with the employees and maybe a fellow customer or two. Shouldn't expect anything for free because they are in business to earn money to support their families. I would prefer to not be teased with a free doughnut üç© if I download the app but after I download the app I search for the free doughnut but cannot find it üòè. Thank you anyway KK for making the best doughnuts I've ever tasted! I hope you don't let it go to your head and start treating customers poorly because we will take abuse to just get a hot fresh now doughnut! üòÇüòÇüòÇ.,2018-01-21 13:24:22,Mynameis who,Krispy Kreme
18,Stole my money,False,1,I wanted to get points so I could get rewards so I decided to put $15 with my card into the app. When I went to the store and tried to pay they couldn‚Äôt take out the money so I had to pay myself. I went ahead and went to another store another day to try and see if maybe it was just the employees but the employees at the other store could not take the money out either. They even tried transferring the money to a gift card and that didn‚Äôt work. This app has a lot of issues. It also states I have a free donut but there‚Äôs no way to redeem it. I ended up emailing customer service about the issues because I felt that I was robbed by the app and to this date there is no response. This is horrible. I went ahead and disputed with my bank. They really need to fix their app ASAP.,2017-11-15 17:54:34,Gicela A.,Krispy Kreme
19,Where‚Äôs my points?!!!,False,1,"I‚Äôve been using the other version of the Krispy Kreme app and I updated today. On the website and emails they‚Äôve sent it said that I would not need to register for a new account and that my points would be converted and transferred. But when I went to log in, it said I had to create an account??? And then I even tried to reset my password and it was not valid, I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on but this needs to be fixed. I had enough points for a free box and now I can‚Äôt even get into the app. When I tried to make an account it wouldn‚Äôt even let me either.

Update: I finally got into the app after reinstalling it, but alll my points are gone, I had enough for a free box and I was promised that my points will vary over but where?!!!! I want my points back",2018-09-02 14:49:51,kemunt0,Krispy Kreme
20,Amazing Donuts @ Amazing Prices,False,5,"Of course their donuts are amazing, but everything else is as well. Often people tell me they think it‚Äôs too expensive, but I explain how KK is actually less expensive than all other donut stores. Between the coupons (mail, paper, email, etc) & the rewards program (app) I never pay more than $11 per 2 dozen (hot & nows &/or picked-assorted). On top of all that I get free dozens from the rewards. So amazing donuts at an amazing price!!

21,The app just keeps kicking me out.,False,1,"I wish I could get into the Krispy Kreme App. I tried everything for the last month or 2. Every time I log in the app logs me out. I have a iPone 8. I event took the app off my phone and tried re-logging back in. Each time I try it kicks me off the app when I click log in.

Luckily each time I have gone in the last two months Krispy Kreme has been able to determine my account by my phone number. But it would be nice to be able to access the app like I used to to see what rewards, offers are available after two months. 

I like what it does offer with a dozen donuts or regular donuts.

I wish there different rewards like if you buy mini donuts or buying drinks besides coffee. My family really does not drink much coffee and we may visit the restaurant normally in the afternoon. 

I also wish there was a Krispy Kreme closer to Amelia Island or in NASSAU County rather than a Dunkin‚Äô Doughnuts or driving all the way to Jacksonville. There is not many breakfast restaurants where we live except for the Waffle House or Dunkin‚Äô Doughnuts so a Krispy Kreme would benefit our town.",2020-09-12 12:02:23,STC's Eagle Scout,Krispy Kreme
22,Way too cumbersome and just doesn‚Äôt work,False,1,"I love Krispy Kreme. Seriously, it‚Äôs an amazing product. However, this app (at least my experience) is far below the standards of their restaurants. I downloaded the app thinking it would be as easy and streamlined as others in this segment like Dunkin and Starbucks. Those seem to work smoothly and allow me to reload cards swiftly and with no glitches. 

However, the Krispy Kreme app has gone completely off of the rails. I downloaded the app, set up my account, attempted many times to load funds onto my account with multiple methods of payment and every one of those triggered a ‚Äúwhoops! Something went wrong‚Äù message. After quite a few attempts I deleted the app to try again another day.  Today was that day. I downloaded the app again, logged in, tried to load funds and again was greeted with ‚ÄúWhoops!...).  I know these MOPs work as I use them daily and have no issues except for the KK app. So it is now deleted, again.

Hoping that Krispy Kreme can Trouble shoot this as I love their product but this app falls short of their reputation.

23,Major kinks,False,3,"For one, you‚Äôre not actually able to make purchases in the app. Instead it routes you to the website which prompts you to input your email and password, which does not save. Also when I tried to remove something from my cart, the drop downs do not have zero and there is no remove button. Since the purchase is not in the app, you cannot swipe either to remove. On top of this, if I log out and re-enter, the things are stuck in my cart. Aside from the rewards this app is not very useful. I plan to purchase from the store and scan for rewards which is almost pointless.",2019-10-26 12:50:51,HelloYou1982,Krispy Kreme
24,Hate the new rewards system!,False,4,"Krispy Kreme used to have it where you could order anything and just accumulate points and spend those points on any product in the app. Now, you have to purchase that specific product in order to receive and redeem points on that specific product. I loved how you guys had it before. I always purchase your variety dozens and I would treat myself with a coffee every once in a while, but now it‚Äôs requiring me to always purchase a coffee in order to be able to redeem a coffee..

Hi, your app isn‚Äôt optimized for the current iOS, and we‚Äôve been on this iOS for a few weeks now. There were betas for said iOS as well. Not having an optimized app, while also encouraging customers to sign up for deals and rewards, is a very bad business strategy and I‚Äôm unsure why Krispy Kreme, quite a major brand, is dawdling here.

As many as they wanted!  I showed your email that explained the promotional to the young lady at the counter and she said they knew nothing about this being a special item.

28,Very disappointed,False,1,Well we dearly love Krispy Kreme. We do not have one near us so when we planned our vacation we decided to go through Lubbock where there is a store. All 8 of us traveling together got out of our vehicles excited to start buying our doughnuts. When we got in the store there were very few doughnuts we couldn‚Äôt believe our eyes we went ahead and bought two dozen of what they had of course none of our favorites. They looked like someone had set on several others were very small others were oddly shaped  & very greasy needless to say they even tasted horrible so in the trash they went. 8 people left very disappointed & we will see how this complaint is handled to see if we ever go back again!!,2019-05-13 00:12:27,Texas Bubbles 33,Krispy Kreme

But I just purchased a gift card and wanted to add it into the app to keep up with it.  Can‚Äôt figure out how to do that - apparently there is no option to add a gift card.  Really??

I downloaded the app a couple weeks ago but could not get signed in. This morning I signed up a new account and got into the app but it‚Äôs pretty much unusable - the rewards and offers page won‚Äôt load and crashes the app - ie throws me out of the app, and pretty much any other menu choice does the same.

But if I go through the drive thru when the hot light isn‚Äôt on.. with the expectation that the donuts are cold, I don‚Äôt expect to spend much time waiting...especially when there are no other customers in the drive thru line and there are sparsely maybe 4 or 5 cars in the parking lot! Every time I go to this park meadows location the workers act like it‚Äôs a hassle to serve...  maybe I‚Äôm wrong, but I thought that was why they‚Äôre paid.

I come to find out that there is not a section to load gift cards on like every other major company from Starbucks to chick fi la.

I‚Äôm not giving it a 1-star because of my poor experience in store.

I am giving it a 1-star experience because you the app will only take new money from a debit card. I am not able to use my ‚ÄúKrispy Kreme Gift Card‚Äù which are American dollars that are only valid at a Krispy Kreme.",2019-05-20 12:37:00,hEMpINEM,Krispy Kreme
33,Ordered donuts for delivery not received,False,1,"I had used the app and paid for 2 dozen donuts to be delivered as a Christmas gift.  I just realized today when placing a separate order that my last order was never delivered. Although bought and paid for my order is sitting in limbo. Nobody has notified me of problems with the delivery.  Even worse, when I select the phone number to call to discuss online orders, the number is not in service!  I love the donuts and service when I pick up or walk in, but online delivery and related online service is a complete failure! On top of it, I look bad because my gift was never received!

34,Overall Krispy Kreme Technology Isn‚Äôt Sweet.,False,2,"Their product may be sweet but their tech and this app are not.  Every message every received remain cluttering the inbox long after no longer relevant.  The menus don‚Äôt match the actual selection at the local store.  There‚Äôs no way to order ahead to have selections ready upon arrival.  The mobile payment system within the app is useless when the store‚Äôs system can‚Äôt receive payment from the app (leaving funds stuck inside the app, wasted).  

There‚Äôs much work to be done here and such a large chain ought to be able to handle it.  Sadly disappointed.",2018-11-20 22:31:02,DaSuss,Krispy Kreme
35,Buggy,False,1,"The app let me add a couple donuts to my cart and then when I went to check out it told me those donuts are not available. If you‚Äôre not available then why did you let me put them in there. 
And then when checking out it gave me an error message so I started over from scratch and when I got to Krispy Kreme I had four dozen donuts instead of two dozen. The first order went through even though the app told me it didn‚Äôt and the people in the store just said ‚Äúyeah both orders went through; they‚Äôre both yours. go ahead and take.‚Äù thanks a lot! now I have four dozen donuts and I spent twice as much as I want to",2021-03-28 11:59:46,SLarsonyann,Krispy Kreme
36,App gone down hill,False,2,The Krispy Kreme app is very convenient when it is working. I would give it a five star except it hasn‚Äôt been working for at least this month. I constantly get errors when trying to make a purchase. I have to close out the app to get it to work again. Then today I went to order some doughnuts for Halloween and when I get on the app it only shows drinks in both the doughnuts and drinks tabs. Basically worthless for what I needed it to do. Now I have to go wait in a long line so I might not have time to buy any. Sad.,2020-10-31 15:18:36,Barba Chinchudo,Krispy Kreme
37,"Fake reviews, broken website",False,1,"So many of the top 5 star reviews are people simply reviewing for rewards of some kind. The app is entirely unusable. You cannot create a new account.

After it crashes, you can no longer use the app as a guest, and you get eternally locked into the sign in screen where the user is given 502 ‚ÄúBad Request‚Äù or ‚ÄúBad Gateway‚Äù errors.

There were no other options, I couldn‚Äôt choose any other doughnut so I tried an I hit randomize my order and it crashed again.

This app rocks on so many levels!! I grew up with KK‚Äôs. That‚Äôs what we called them back in the 60‚Äôs.

At the store, never once have i been able scan for the rewards program - they must ALWAYS enter my cell number to record a purchase for rewards.   Offers come to my email (not the app), so when I click the offer, it opens the app, but the special offer is not there and i have to go back to the email.  Finally, my new location just doesn‚Äôt exist... at least as the app is concerned.

I recently updated the app to the new Krispy Kreme experience and I am a huge fan of the redesign! However upon further searching I can‚Äôt find where my points transferred over from the old system.

49,Works well missing a key feature,False,4,I‚Äôve never had any issues with the app it does what it is supposed to. But why can‚Äôt I add the rewards card to Apple Wallet?  Just about every other app from a food company that uses a rewards feature allow you to add it to the wallet for convenient access. Some places even have it show up on the lock screen for even quicker access. Just a thought,2018-07-14 19:50:07,cjo85,Krispy Kreme
50,Lies and tracking,False,1,"First off, app doesn‚Äôt work without full location allowance. So glad I can have my battery dead by lunch time by allowing KRISPY BLOODY KREME to know my exact location even when not using the app. Fantastic. Also, the whole reason I downloaded was a lie. No free doughnut for app ordering. No special deals. Just Krispy Kreme‚Äôs way of saying ‚Äúwe know where you are and aren‚Äôt willing to offer any positive experience in exchange for this luxury‚Äù 
This app is beyond terrible. Why are there still so many braindead morons saying this app works? It doesn‚Äôt fulfill any of the intended or stated purposes. Wish I could give it less than 1 star.",2018-02-04 15:11:23,Big Seahorse,Krispy Kreme

Occasionally, randomly, it will transfer. 
 I have tried my wi-fi,  LTE, and KK's guest wi-fi, all with bad results. I dumped and reloaded the app. I also restarted my iPhone.

I now have to buy a dozen orders of a dozen doughnuts before I get a free dozen. It is *much* harder to get rewards now, and frankly, not worth it anymore. Best thing about this app is the hot light feature, but I‚Äôve discovered it isn‚Äôt as accurate as one would hope. This app has gone from essential to a waste of time.

Now I‚Äôm seeing that there is no rewards point tally, but that I have a free dozen.  What am I going to do with a dozen?? AND it expires in December!  Points down the drain?  I used to be motivated to earn points, but no longer.  The fun is gone!

55,Disappointing,False,2,"The app with its rewards system was one of my favorites. However, after redesign and reward system change - it‚Äôs completely useless. Take this for example, before if you buy a couple of dozen donuts you could score a free donut or coffee. Now if you buy 11 coffees, plus 11 donuts, plus 11 dozen - you will have nothing, like literally, with new rewards system you can spend more than a hundred dollars and not score a single free item.

Look KK already closed once in Billings, let‚Äôs not make it twice over crappy service. Finally a manager said, ‚ÄúMam,
I will fix it for you this time, but it‚Äôs not
our job to ask. Well gee wiz gomer pike even Starbucks and JCP ask you if your a reward member. Hello, it keeps people
coming back. Remember KK donuts
aren‚Äôt a necessity. If I get that service again I will go to my local bakery, they sell bread, croissants, rolls, oh and donuts!!!

Last week, the option to customize a dozen was missing and only box of joe coffee available. Yesterday I could customize my dozen, and no speciality coffee, and today no donuts at all show but there are pages of coffee options on the donut tab.

58,Needs Improvement,False,2,Placed an order for pick-up yet the app shows no order history & also didn‚Äôt give an option to save my card info when placing the order. I was not given a receipt so I couldn‚Äôt even get credit towards my rewards. It makes no sense to have to still scan in to get rewards when placing an online order.

I was excited at first, but then I realized that instead of receiving a dozen free donuts after buying five or six dozen donuts, I now had to purchase 12 dozen donuts. They essentially doubled the amount of donuts that you have to buy in order to get a free dozen. We almost always eat our donuts at the store as well, but the app doesn‚Äôt take into account me purchasing drinks or milk, only donuts.

I did....they didn‚Äôt. 13 trips to Krispy Kreme and have yet to get a single reward point. Zero! Rewards hotline said get a receipt and call us every time and we will credit your act.

It would take my fingerprint, and then the little donut would spin and spin until it timed out. It‚Äôs almost like they have 24,789,623 people trying to use an app designed to be used by 125 people.

78,"Placed an order, app crashed but still charged my card.",False,1,My first time ordering through the rewards app and it charged my card. The app gave me an error about my rewards and the order never went through on the store‚Äôs end but still charged my card. I  Contacted both the store and the customer support number and neither were able to assist me. I was told that by customer service they are unable to help me with online orders.

79,Needs work,False,2,"Definitely not a high quality or highly dependable app for that matter that one would expect from a corporation to release. Very difficult to navigate, logs you out at nearly every page change, and no real way of saving your favorite store? Mine keep defaulting back to Jacksonville Fl and I live in Virginia?

80,Love ...but,False,5,I love Krispy Kreme App...points are added fairly quickly. My problem or pet peeve is why cant we erase our messages after they have been opened/read/received. They are not necessarily taking up memory on my phone but it irritates me that I cant delete messages from February 2017 and it is April 2018. Other than this...love it!,2018-04-22 11:14:21,57NE24,Krispy Kreme
81,Yum,False,4,I like the app for the rewards. Has been very beneficial until today. I tried to check my app for my points. I wanted to redeem them before I go out of town tomorrow. But the app is telling me ‚Äúsomething went wrong while trying to open app‚Äù. Everything is updated they had an update last week to fix bugs... but def still has one right now.,2018-05-17 11:31:46,Lalalaurencampbell,Krispy Kreme
82,Problem with app,False,2,Tried to put in a missed transaction on app to get rewards. You have to pick your location first and my location was not on the drop down menu. Emailed using the email provided in the app. Response to email was ‚Äúsend us all the info and we will put it in and you‚Äôll see the results in 7-14 days.‚Äù Great - but you didn‚Äôt address the problem of my store not being in the list of local stores!,2020-06-16 16:39:00,jkhxcy,Krispy Kreme
83,Doesn‚Äôt even work. Crashes immediately after opening,False,1,"I would give this 0 stars if possible. They changed the rewards system with 0 notice a couple years back and you lost all rewards you had. Now, the app won‚Äôt even work at all. Open it and it either crashes immediately or I get a pop up that says ‚Äúuh oh! The data couldn‚Äôt be read because it isn‚Äôt in the correct format‚Äù Just horrible customer service to have a garbage app for such a big company. Pathetic would give 0 stars if possible.",2019-09-29 14:31:38,Jmitch83,Krispy Kreme
84,Payment Method,False,2,"This app works fine on a very basic level. My one major complaint is the payment method. Right now it only allows people to add a credit card but I have gift cards that I use, but every time I get to the cashier, they have to manually type in the barcode number, since the barcode itself won‚Äôt scan properly. If I can add the gift card to my app and pay straight from there, that would make my transactions so much smoother and faster.",2019-12-18 03:50:14,Actuary44,Krispy Kreme
85,Please fix the app,False,4,"This app is amazing, and yes I come to my local store weekly. 
But recently the app either doesn‚Äôt recognize My email or it will close the app. This needs some bug fixes because I know each visit rewards you with points, and yes I can still give my number at the cashier, but when will I redeem any of my points if the app is not working?",2018-10-25 13:50:24,elizlolo,Krispy Kreme
86,"Can‚Äôt use coupons, small selection, can‚Äôt buy a dozen",False,1,"I bought a fundraiser card. I can‚Äôt use it on the app.
I tried to order a dozen assorted donuts. The app tries to charge them individually instead of buy the dozen.
I told the store employee that the app was only letting me select a few donuts, not the entire menu. He said the store manager sets it up that way.
Everything I would use the app for (to order a customized dozen, to use a coupon) I can‚Äôt do on the app. So the app is almost entirely useless to me.",2020-09-19 23:49:16,joe hungry pizza man,Krispy Kreme
87,Doesn‚Äôt load.,False,4,"Since the update, app doesn‚Äôt load. Only shows the icon but doesn‚Äôt do anything after that. Luckily my KK allows the phone number for points.

88,Need a scanner at drive thru,False,2,"This app is just ok. One thing is that they don‚Äôt have a scanner at the Akron location so they have to take your phone(unlocked) into the store. Where the register is located I can‚Äôt see them. Also, my birthday rewards don‚Äôt show up. I received the email and followed the instructions but once I got there the cashier said it wouldn‚Äôt work and acted like I had already used it and was trying to get free food.

90,Login issues and no Apple Pay,False,2,"I have to log in every time I open this app. It never remembers my account information, and I‚Äôve had to reset my password many times because the app doesn‚Äôt trigger my phone to recognize it as a user name and password to save. Also, why does this app not take Apple Pay? You lost my order to Dunkin‚Äô today, because I could Apple Pay in their app without having a card with me.",2020-07-18 16:19:33,B√∂hme417,Krispy Kreme
91,New Update Dissappointing!!,False,1,"Sorry, but I think the New Update of this app is worse. It takes too much longer to get rewarded. Can't get rid of messages- old messages- not sure why there isn't a delete ability especially after the message is old or expired. I LOVED THE OLD APP because it seemed you got a free donut or free drink much quicker and it made me go back to Krispy Kreme more. I MISS THE POINT SYSTEM too! Now it takes so much longer and I feel I will not go back as much as I use too. PLEASE CONDSIDER revamping your app rewards- not much of a rewards program anymore.",2018-10-28 22:31:51,sandy2122,Krispy Kreme

The appIt made this up. I‚Äôm adding in my part. Sometimes works.  But took all my points at end of March. This years too. The last 2 visits it‚Äôs made me religious in and won‚Äôt take my password. The folks at the window are very helpful and always understanding no matter what time. 
 

it never does I have to sign in with my phone number which frustrates me and the people at the window I never know what the points are actually going to get on there or if I have to keep my last receipt so that's a bummer all the way around.",2018-05-06 17:30:10,Mag 007,Krispy Kreme
93,Error when I try to load money to use,False,1,"I like the concept of this app because it is nice to have been a pinch when you don‚Äôt have your wallet on you like I tend to do sometimes but if I can‚Äôt load money onto it using my card then what‚Äôs the point of having the availability to pay with the app, every time I try to do it I keep getting an error message or being timed out is really something that needs to be fixed in order for the app to be effective, if that‚Äôs the case I‚Äôll just pay with my card",2018-12-23 13:48:41,Chris42485,Krispy Kreme
94,Missing rewards,False,1,I had 5 dozen free donuts. Just went into MV location and It showed no rewards. Several months ago I purchased 12 dz for work. They automatically used 4 of my rewards. I was saving them for another time. They cancel out the transaction. But I never received my rewards my rewards back or for the current purchased. Staff said I needed to call corporate office. I emailed with no response. Frustrating Staff has no idea how to check app or anything about the app. Or give rewards. Of course no manager was ‚Äúthere‚Äù to help either.,2018-12-09 18:49:59,dhaubner,Krispy Kreme
95,Points disappear after every update!!!,False,1,"I downloaded this app because I buy donuts for my coworkers a couple times a month. Every time the app has updated, all my points have disappeared when I log back in. I had enough points for a free dozen donuts twice and when I updated the app all the points disappeared both times after logging back in. This is very frustrating. What‚Äôs the point of having a rewards system if your points get reset after every update? Please fix and give me back my points",2018-09-02 21:31:39,BlueDevil33,Krispy Kreme
96,Can't log into site nor my rewards,False,2,When my phone updated it's made my app not work it says that I'm not even in the system and when I try to get in the system it say not valid email account I'm disappointed cause I was very close in point to get a free dozen but can't login with my email and I made an account when the shop opened up in my home town wish I could get help with login account and I also can't even reset password or nothing ....,2017-08-07 04:55:32,Ravenshadowqueen21,Krispy Kreme
97,Garbage right off the bat.,False,1,Somehow I created my account via the app but other than that; this app offers NO advantages over simply using a web browser. Any time I try to order it redirects to Safari and after enough attempts at hitting the ‚Äúorder now‚Äù button it logs me out and displays an error message stating ‚ÄúThe info seems to be in the incorrect format‚Äù. Only when closing the app and restarting my phone does it allow me to log in. I cant stress enough how pointless this app is for me in its current state. Please do something.,2019-08-23 00:00:38,Gazorpini,Krispy Kreme
98,Rewards Points Gone,False,1,"Ever since the app went down for maintenance my app isn‚Äôt functioning correctly. I‚Äôve updated it to see if that would help but it didn‚Äôt. I lost ALL of my reward pints, the app is constantly force closing, or not opening at all. I wish you could enter your phone number or add your barcode to Apple Pay to earn and redeem points.

99,Rewards earned then disappeared,False,1,"Was happy to finally getting my first reward. But today went to buy two dozens and decided to not use the reward (i had a coupon from a local fundraiser instead), and marked on the app to not use it when scanning. Reward now completely disappeared from my account. Double checked my receipt and got charged for one, and shwos fundraiser promo for second, no mention of the reward. Just gone. What is the point of the rewards then?",2022-03-24 03:33:23,scuac,Krispy Kreme

101,Solid app but needs a tweak,False,4,"In the app you should have the ability to type in a tip amount for your driver for delivery/no contact delivery. Even selecting the max (20%) feels too small if you‚Äôre only ordering 1 dozen. Makes me feel cheap, and I don‚Äôt always have extra cash around to leave for the driver.",2020-11-21 17:00:06,KPraz,Krispy Kreme
102,Krispy Kreme App is Horrible,False,1,"On the app it says I have only bought one dozen of donuts and zero coffees!!! I have bought at least 20 dozens of doughnuts since downloading the app and becoming a rewards member. And I always purchase at least 2 drinks each time I go. AND they can never scan my phone with the barcode, they always ask to TAKE my phone and type it in manually EVERY single time. That‚Äôs not sanitary and they haven‚Äôt even been giving me my points! Waste of my time.",2021-10-28 01:21:03,ADHINMELOSSA,Krispy Kreme
103,Good app but...,False,4,"I love Krispy Kreme and love their rewards program but when you want to customize you can‚Äôt seem to choose one flavor more than once.

You get an error message.",2021-01-13 01:07:16,El Gordo de Oro,Krispy Kreme
104,Missed rewards,False,2,I‚Äôm convinced this app doesn‚Äôt accurately reflect my purchases. It needs a history option like Starbucks app. I just bought 3 dozen and 2 coffees 2 days ago but have no coffees on my app and only 3 dozen on my dozen rewards. I should have more dozens plus the 2 coffees. Keep and check your receipts! I give two stars because I‚Äôve had the app a long time and I have earned a free dozen but it took way longer than expected. I should have earned a free coffee by now!,2020-01-05 20:13:47,hoskihouse,Krispy Kreme

106,Employees don‚Äôt know how to use it,False,1,I have been to 3 different locations in San Antonio and have witnessed employees literally arguing over the app. I tell them ‚ÄúI need to pay with my app‚Äù and they always say ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt do that.‚Äù Really?!?! Then why does it give me the option? Why can I load funds? I utilize KK a lot for work purchased $130 worth this Saturday did I get any of my points? Nope. Did I get to use my app to pay? Nope. Why? Because your own employees have no idea how to use it. Why have an app if you‚Äôre not going to train employees how to use it?,2017-10-09 23:17:13,Vcasanova,Krispy Kreme
107,App doesn‚Äôt work!,False,1,"You would think with all the negative reviews they would fix their app! Downloaded app and try signing in, and it said I already have an account. Try signing in with forgot password and the app shut down. Now can‚Äôt even open app, it keeps shutting down! You would  think that whoever is in charge would have the app fixed! I guess when you get to be a big corporation you forget the people who help get you there! SHAME ON YOU!!!",2020-09-28 16:32:04,Odessa54,Krispy Kreme
108,Disappointed,False,3,"I love being able to place an online order, cruise into the donut shop and smoothly glide out with my order already boxed and bagged.

I am trying to enter a receipt from when I went to a Krispy Kreme yesterday and the location isn‚Äôt showing up on the app under the rewards section.

111,Ehhh,False,3,I‚Äôve had this app for a little while now and always thought it was a little faulty. I‚Äôve always been able to use it in store fine though. But I just checked my app and now all of my points are gone. I guess they expire??? It would‚Äôve been nice to know that just because I don‚Äôt go to KK very often.

It‚Äôs been about 2 weeks since then and the welcome coupon is gone. I‚Äôm going to a local doughnut shop next time just because the app upset me and lowered my opinion of Krispy Kreme in general.

Original:
I have had this app for a few days. I have made two purchases and none of them are showing up in the points section. There is no description of the reward system (what dollar amount equals how many many points). I'm disappointed.

I have emailed three times. The first time I was told to wait up to two weeks. At two weeks, I sent another email. No response. After three weeks I send another email. So far, no response. Also the app never asked for my birthday, which it listed incorrectly...",2018-12-02 13:08:01,FFIY,Krispy Kreme
115,App is unwilling to sign me in or let me start over,False,1,I can no longer sign in using social media. Can‚Äôt start a new account because I have already registered my email via social media sign in. Can‚Äôt reset my password because I was on a social media account and so never had a password. This app is basically telling me my business is no longer wanted at Krispy Kreme - and naturally my birthday is this weekend and I‚Äôll miss out on a birthday treat while this incompetent app fails to work. Guess I‚Äôm no longer a customer eh?,2018-09-07 17:43:59,Evh1234,Krispy Kreme

118,Inaccurate,False,2,"The app is an inaccurate representation of what is actually available, and the inability to order what‚Äôs available is very frustrating.

They could not refund my money in the store & told me to contact customer service for a refund. Customer service told me the app was through a 3rd party & they couldn‚Äôt refund my money either, but to just dispute the charge with my bank. WTH?? Deleting app now & going to Dunkin‚Äô Donuts",2019-06-01 18:44:46,G.G. Girls,Krispy Kreme
132,Edit the profile,False,3,I hope the developers of the app update the app because there is no way one can edit their email on the app. I need to edit my email but I have to go through a long process of a phone call and the phone calls are not reliable. I rather do it on my own. I will give it 5 stars if that option was available.,2018-04-05 13:06:24,Update_sucks_,Krispy Kreme
133,No benefit,False,1,This is the worst food app.  It‚Äôs clunky and If they have a special offer you can‚Äôt use it if you order online.  They have no method for curbside pickup-in Savannah you have to knock for minutes on a locked door to get your cold donuts.  Better to drive through and wait in line. Total waste of time.  Makes me wish their donuts were worse-because I feel screwed every time I patronize them and drive 40 miles for a donut...,2020-05-24 15:11:02,Yucked,Krispy Kreme
134,Quite lame,False,2,"You can‚Äôt use a gift card on the app or the website. Seriously? Why would I gift anyone a Krispy Kreme gift card if they can‚Äôt redeem it unless you drive to a store? It‚Äôs 2020, nearly every retail app allows you to use a gift card. Took me 20 minutes to place an order because I could not accept the fact that you can‚Äôt pay with a gift card. Lame.",2020-05-05 02:38:07,Honest Alia,Krispy Kreme
135,When it Works It‚Äôs Great,False,3,The app is great when it running normally and I‚Äôve previously had good success with it. But for some reason today it‚Äôs acting buggy. No way to go back to look at your rewards if you have something in your cart without losing the contents of you cart. Then the app kicked me out.,2020-10-12 02:31:37,Teamsloan06,Krispy Kreme
136,No choices,False,1,"So basically you can choose only mini donuts and orange juice. Under coffee and drinks, orange juice is the only option. A few weeks ago I was able to order a dozen variety of whatever donut flavor I wanted and now it‚Äôs one option. Just don‚Äôt launch your app until you‚Äôve straightened out the bugs. We should be able to choose any assorted dozen, and whatever drinks and other items are on your menu.",2021-12-22 03:30:07,ugh27272277,Krispy Kreme
137,Rewards only,False,2,"No mobile ordering. During holidays and family gatherings, we often order a bunch of doughnuts. The store generally does a good job but I was hoping to try mobile ordering. I should have read the details first; the app is only for rewards. Also, while trying to sign up, if I went back into the app to continue the signup process, the signup process restarted from the beginning.",2018-12-26 19:58:28,Exit52B,Krispy Kreme
138,Not a fan,False,2,"1. Every time the app updates, have to completely login with I‚Äôd and password... don‚Äôt wait to check when you are in front of line.

2. Promotions and pay are not integrated. Email promos not in app and was told today at store...you have to tell me what you want so I can get to the right screen. At La Madeline‚Äôs you scan and promos automatically deducted and credit card is charged...really fast and easy.",2018-11-17 13:40:33,Buckeye#42,Krispy Kreme
139,Poor design,False,1,"This app relies solely on scanning the barcode at the cashier BEFORE making a payment. If the scan failed, I highly recommend canceling the order and try again which requires manager override.  It makes me wonder how many times the store manager would put up with it especially when the store is fully packed with customers standing in line.  What they should have done is to allow the receipt numbers to be keyed into the app afterward for point earning.",2018-04-17 23:17:50,Singsiblaw,Krispy Kreme
140,I love these donuts,False,5,I love using the app to get some discounts. The donuts are always great. It‚Äôs a win-win situation! I think the scan page should be a little bigger because sometimes it does not scan at the register but besides that everything is good.,2018-02-04 14:15:03,Doubledelight,Krispy Kreme
141,App won‚Äôt let me create an account or sign in,False,1,"Tried creating an account through the web browser. It said I had to have the latest app installed, so I installed the app. Tried creating my account through the app, filled out all fields correctly, and then got an error message saying the data could not be read because it‚Äôs not in the correct format. All I wanted to do was order some donuts!! So frustrating and a complete waste of time.",2020-02-07 12:27:11,jk2913,Krispy Kreme
142,Graduation,False,3,We drove for 45 minutes because that is the closest place to get hot and now delicious donuts. When we got there we wanted to get a dozen hot and now and a dozen chocolate covered. When we saw the small amount of chocolate that was on the donuts we asked the lady if they could put more on the donut but she said the machine was cut off and they were not able. Other than that I love it,2018-06-13 15:58:14,I love my donuts,Krispy Kreme
143,"Bad App, Reward Program Has Tons of Bugs",False,1,"Donut is good, but the app is bad. The City of Industry, CA store I normally go to often say their scanner has problem, and when I gave them my phone number, they say they cannot find it in the system either. Even worse, when I try to claim a ‚Äúmissed transaction‚Äù for the reward program, the app keep saying error to find the transaction... It was almost like they purposely not give me the credit for the reward program...",2019-12-13 03:50:01,KC of Los Angeles,Krispy Kreme
144,GLITCH,False,1,"I am unsure if the App is compatible with ios-13 on iphone, everytime I put in my login information it goes to the next step and then it closes the App and I have to open the App again and put in my login information but I am unable to get pass this step. I have deleted the App several times hoping I will get different results. Is it the ios-13 software or the App needs to be updated to be compatible. Someone Please look into this. Thanks!",2019-09-24 14:25:49,Pilladigga funny time,Krispy Kreme
145,Frustration trying to register,False,2,"I'm just trying to sign up and it's already acting buggy. It loses all progress if I close out of the app (not kill it) to go elsewhere to copy my password. Then when I click ""paste"" in the app, nothing happens. I'd really like this to work because my passwords are long and complex. The shortcuts (like clicking on, rather than entering in my phone number) aren't working either",2019-03-21 00:05:25,SingInTheCar,Krispy Kreme
146,Great app but....,False,5,It would be better if you could scan the receipt after your purchase and be able to get your points. If I don‚Äôt have my phone with me I miss out on any points I could have received.,2018-05-17 12:11:08,Whitleymom,Krispy Kreme
147,Love the app but....,False,2,"I enjoy using this app when I go to kk, however, I receive msgs saying that I have free rewards but nothing appears when I open the barcode. If the rewards do show up when I select the barcode they disappear so fast I don‚Äôt have a chance to see what I can get. The most recent update seems to have caused this glitch with no fix in sight. Please fix so I can Lee enjoying this app to the fullest potential.",2017-12-02 22:34:00,allbetzroff,Krispy Kreme
148,Issues in store and can not order online,False,5,I think the team could be more educated on how to use the app. Also it would be great if we could order on the app to pick up in the store like other food apps such as Chick-fil-a and Panera.,2017-09-14 13:39:43,Shameka923,Krispy Kreme
149,Difficult,False,2,I have tried several times to get my free doughnut and I always end up buying a couple a dozen donuts not getting the free one what is the problem with the store having the donuts that‚Äôs on the menu in drive-through this is becoming so difficult and instead of continue  dealing with this app it doesn‚Äôt pull stuff up or the store that I go to in Owings Mills Maryland I‚Äôm bout to just stop dealing with Krispy Kreme altogether,2018-03-26 14:30:35,Marcia's gift,Krispy Kreme
150,Krispy Kreme APP,False,1,I‚Äôm not sure if this is only happening to me. I downloaded the APP but everytime I try to open it‚Ä¶ it tells me ‚Äúunable to securely connect to server.‚Äù So I removed & deleted the APP & tried installing it again‚Ä¶ but all the same problem. Did this happen to anyone who downloaded the APP & experienced the same problem? I guess Krispy Kreme should check this problem. I believed they need to fix the bug in their APP,2021-09-14 00:44:52,ggand004,Krispy Kreme
151,Kk,False,5,"Love the coupons and love the doughnuts.  I wish you would put one in Shallotte, NC. I had to drive 39 miles one way to Myrtle Beach or 37 miles one way to Wilmington to get one and not talking about ones on Grocery shelf. The real hot and now cannot be beat. We have no treats in Shallotte. Pleaseüå∑‚ù§Ô∏è",2018-08-08 18:09:00,Griswolds mummy,Krispy Kreme
152,Never get what I pay for,False,1,"I don‚Äôt like that you can‚Äôt use your reward points with online orders. They make you go inside the store to use them. Also any time I order through the app they give me doughnuts I didn‚Äôt ask for or replace a doughnut with a mini doughnut if they‚Äôre out of them, it‚Äôs annoying that my order is never what I paid for i feel like I keep getting scamed like is this a joke?",2021-10-29 16:48:59,Xaigaa,Krispy Kreme
153,Broken!,False,1,"I do remember a day when this app worked, but it‚Äôs been a while.  If you download and set up a rewards account, I recommend NOT using the Facebook option.  I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs where they broke their own app.  I sent another email this week and got this response:

Thank you for your email regarding our Krispy Kreme rewards app . We appreciate the opportunity to assist you. Unfortunately, when Corporate released an update I caused some minor glitches with the app. As of right now we can not reset passwords for your account. We are not sure when Corporates going to have a fix for this. we do apologize for any inconvenience this has caused. 

On 4/12 another update was released... and yet again the app doesn‚Äôt work.

155,Disappointed,False,1,"I‚Äôve gotten emails saying that I earned or was gifted things (like a birthday reward etc). But no where in the app does it say that I have something or what it is that I earned; how are you supposed to know what to get and before when to get it so that it doesn‚Äôt expire??

Also, I would suggest adding a section where you can submit a receipt for points in case you didn‚Äôt get your app scanned‚Äîlike going through the drive through",2017-10-17 20:48:01,Missliteral,Krispy Kreme
156,Times,False,1,"I love the app, but would like to suggest a few things. First, I think that the start time of the hot and ready light should be listed to let consumers know if they are at the front or back end of the rush. Second, the average time of the light could be listed. Finally, the best idea would be average time of hot and ready light. These suggestions would be great for anticipating the light for customers that want fresh donuts but aren't near a particularly close location.",2017-07-11 01:09:23,gregormarpham,Krispy Kreme
157,Best donuts worst app,False,1,"I have installed, deleted and reinstalled this app a few times now. Let me first say, I LOVE KRISPY KREME and wish more than anyone I could love this app. 

For some reason, this app never works for me. The rewards/barcode never loads and most recently I can‚Äôt make an order‚Äî I keep seeing a basket error. 

Will delete for now and reinstall later again in hopes that it gets better (only because I love Krispy Kreme so much).",2020-05-09 23:28:02,s s son,Krispy Kreme
158,Dead app.. shuts down every time.,False,1,"I‚Äôve never even been able to fully log in to this app - SO FRUSTRATING! It either gives me the error that my password isn‚Äôt in the correct format or of I can get past that it completely shuts down every time the pop up asks if it can use my location. I‚Äôve deleted and redownloaded the app MULTIPLE times and no fixes. This is so frustrating, really wish you guys could fix this.",2019-09-29 15:02:10,me+you.,Krispy Kreme
159,Horrible Site Support,False,1,"Had the exact same experience as '93 Bruin. They need to hire people who know what they're doing, not just throw a crappy app together and expect people to go out of their way to fix their own Krispy Kreme rewards accounts. Ridiculously complicated and zero support behind it all.  I called at some point and the lady was totally clueless about the app and the website and had no idea how to help me or who to refer me to. I gave up on this a long time ago.",2019-05-06 12:51:02,Majka1979,Krispy Kreme
160,I T  S U C K S,False,5,This app works so bad that when I went in with a friend to redeem our free donuts the cashier got so frustrated with the app himself he gave us our five donuts for free and  said ‚Äúwhatever just take them and leave‚Äù so I guess I‚Äôll be using the app again,2018-08-09 04:13:03,cheapskate for free donuts,Krispy Kreme
161,Stopped working,False,1,"My KK app stopped working with one of the last updates.  It won‚Äôt let me log in, app keeps crashing after opening, tells me that I can‚Äôt retrieve lost password, so I‚Äôve lost all the points and freebies I earned!  Sadly this app has become extremely useless and I haven‚Äôt been to Krispy Kreme in months now because of this.  I‚Äôve emailed/messaged KK, to which I haven‚Äôt gotten any responses on how to fix this and get my account back!!  Worthless app now.",2018-11-12 12:03:19,pbjb30,Krispy Kreme
162,No Custom Tip for Delivery,False,2,"The app is fine for getting donuts and having them delivered because I‚Äôm too lazy to get my own. But I think it‚Äôs pretty dumb that they do not allow me to tip someone what I want to bring said donuts. It caps it at 20%, and even if I order two dozen, that‚Äôs only about $5. I shouldn‚Äôt have to ask the delivery driver for their cash app, Venmo, Google pay, etc.",2022-03-05 00:10:17,Ghost household,Krispy Kreme
163,"Can‚Äôt view, change, or cancel order?",False,1,"Why is there no way to access an order placed the day before pickup? I can‚Äôt make a change, cancel, or even confirm that my order still exists. When I call the shop directly, they also can‚Äôt access my order or even confirm that it exists, let alone change or cancel it. So, now what? I get charged for something I can‚Äôt pick up?

The app, and the website, are utterly worthless. üëéüèæ",2018-11-14 22:37:39,fjpoblam,Krispy Kreme
165,New Update,False,2,"Since the new update it automatically signed me out of my account, which I knew it was going to happen. But whenever I tried logging in, especially with resetting my password, it is asking for my security answer but the question seems like a bunch of numbers and letters, instead of an actual question and I am not able to log in.",2018-09-07 13:04:47,hellotherek,Krispy Kreme
166,What is even happening?,False,1,"Had this app downloaded for awhile. Error messages kept coming up saying the app won‚Äôt open. I deleted the app in an attempt to re-download it, but when i go to the App Store, it says the app is still installed.

167,Add payment options,False,1,"You need to add a payment option to where we can add egift cards and gift cards to the app. You should also teach your employees how to use your registers, two out of the last 5 times they couldn‚Äôt figure out how to put an e-gift card in to pay for my order, so they tried to tell me they don‚Äôt except them, after other employees put them in on visits 1,3,4.... and yes I walked out and you are about to loose a customer",2018-08-21 02:14:25,CedMik,Krispy Kreme
168,Rewards,False,2,The rewards rarely register on app and if I try to enter a missed transaction it says it can not be found. I have had this app for over a year and get a specialty drink almost every time but it says I have bought 0 and says I have only bought 5 dozen donuts when I buy a dozen about twice a month if not more.,2021-12-28 03:50:32,val3690,Krispy Kreme
169,Can‚Äôt earn rewards when ordering on app,False,2,"App says u earn rewards with each online order, but I ordered a coffee each day for a week and it never registered that I bought anything.

170,Bad APP,False,1,I used my Facebook logon to set up this APP. I have closed my Facebook account now I can‚Äôt logon because my Facebook account is closed and I have a $25 dollar card on the APP. I have asked them several times if they can help me change my logon so that I can access my account and use my $25 credit but I have never received a response. I can‚Äôt believe they won‚Äôt help me and they don‚Äôt even respond.,2020-10-24 07:04:41,Siggy51,Krispy Kreme
171,Please add a gift card load option,False,3,This app is pretty to use but it would be great to have an option to load in a gift card.  That way my gift card balance is readily available in my app vs getting frustrated that I forgot my gift card and deciding I‚Äôll stop another time when I have my gift card.,2020-01-16 19:54:45,SammieB90,Krispy Kreme
172,Why can‚Äôt I order through the app?!,False,2,I really don‚Äôt understand the purpose of creating an app with an ‚Äúorder now‚Äù that doesn‚Äôt let you order. It‚Äôs bonkers that I select this simply to be taken to a webpage that requires me to sign in again and select my store. This is dumb. I love Krispy Kreme donuts but it should not be this hard. Clearly the developer doesn‚Äôt understand the purpose of an app.,2019-09-02 19:31:25,JenBW8,Krispy Kreme
173,The worst app,False,1,"This is one of  the worst app ever. I tried to do pick up but it constantly open safari but still won‚Äôt let me order. Then I tried to look up the flavor and again, it opens up safari. What‚Äôs the point of an app if its constantly opening up the safari! On top of, I still couldn‚Äôt order. AND the coupon doesn‚Äôt get linked so I ended up ordering in the store. Utterly useless. I have no idea what the point of this app is",2019-05-17 23:14:03,Mjung0228,Krispy Kreme
174,App is hacked,False,1,I never setup a security question. I go to reset password and the security question is a string of letters and numbers; which looks like codes or whatever. There‚Äôs no way for me to even reset my account password! This app had buggy problems even when I signed up!

175,No competition,False,5,"I learned to love KK many years ago, and my family inherited the taste.

176,Needs overhaul,False,1,This app isn‚Äôt really good at all. First you don‚Äôt get your free donut. Also this app should have the menu per store so that you know exactly what store has for donuts and such. I‚Äôve read some bad reviews about transferring money from your debit to the app so I will not use that feature. The store has enough counter space to start a order on the go like dunkin does.

Now they give dozens and even worse is they automatically subtract your dozens whether you want them to or not.  No other customer loyalty reward program FORCES you to use your rewards.

I hope a future update will address this issue.",2021-12-20 18:53:31,Ckierste,Krispy Kreme
192,Love Krispy Kreme!,False,5,"I‚Äôve been very happy using this app- always a convenience and it‚Äôs nice knowing I can earn freebies just for using it!  
You have a location in Brandon that was really convenient during Club volleyball season- our club team LOVES these donuts!",2018-06-20 04:47:49,BEVA Mom,Krispy Kreme
193,I wish no stars was an option,False,1,"Horrible app.  When you order, you‚Äôre taken to the website to order outside of the app.

Then when you do order, you can order donuts the store doesn‚Äôt have available so you drive all the way there, just to be told you can either cancel the order or substitute other varieties you didn‚Äôt really want.   I don‚Äôt understand why this is even an app.  Terrible.",2019-08-11 23:03:12,JenTunes,Krispy Kreme
194,App update,False,1,"I have used the app for a while now with no issue then when I finally get the free dozen I have to update so I update and now it can not find my account. I ask for a pin to reset my password I check my email then it goes back to the home screen. I have tried five different times, and the bad part is I know it is my correct password because it was protected by my thumb print. So frustrating!!",2019-04-25 12:33:40,RubaDuck,Krispy Kreme
195,What happen to my points!!,False,2,I like the new design and everything but where is my points that was suppose to roll over once it was updated. What‚Äôs the point of having a app on our phone to gain points from our purchases and we lose our points from an simple update. Can you please give everyone there points back?,2018-09-04 02:42:22,She-J,Krispy Kreme
196,Great rewards,False,5,This is a great app and every so often they have free offers that only those with the app get to enjoy such as a free donut or other offers plus you can earn free food and drinks by using the app aside from this .,2018-06-20 01:44:21,SS-12,Krispy Kreme
197,I Love This APP!,False,5,I collect points on every purchase. I have gotten several free dozen donuts with my points. And when the Carolina Panthers win I get points automatically added. The hot now light has always been accurate on my app.,2017-10-02 13:58:12,jgal522,Krispy Kreme
198,It is great,False,4,i love Krispy Kreme but the way to get rewards could be more clear. The app is not buggy and the layout is very simple and basic. I like the feature where the viewer at home can see if the local Krispy Kreme has ready hot donuts. I would encourage any doughnut lover to get this app!,2018-02-19 16:53:36,Trevor.Scott,Krispy Kreme
199,App is acting weird,False,1,The app messes up whenever I use it at night. I normally use my phone to get donuts at night. Whenever I go to the scan page on my phone it automatically turns my brightness all the way up to max. I‚Äôve tried to see if it was just a glitch but it happens every time. I have an iPhone 8 Plus updated to the most recent iOS update. Please fix this guys. These phones get really bright and hurt my eyes bad.,2018-01-04 04:48:54,Fuq'm,Krispy Kreme
