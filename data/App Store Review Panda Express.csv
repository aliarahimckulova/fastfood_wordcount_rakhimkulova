I don’t have a card or Apple Pay because my I don’t work and my parents doesn’t let me have an account. A lot of apps don’t do cash which is wierd because people like me then can’t order food and I can’t go and pick it up cause I’m 15. If someone was home I’d ask them to order food for me. But since it’s just me and my sis, who is the same age as me, and both of us doesn’t have an account or Apple Pay, we can’t have any food. Now we are gonna have to make some, which is fine, but I came home at 5 pm from school, almost 10 hours.

I have gotten the same thing every time ever since panda express opened in Michigan city and I’ve never had an issue until they have done the carry out orders only. I order a large orange chicken only and when I brought it to the point of them not filling it up the whole way I always get an excuse or they try to explain to me they only fill it up to the line which is OK if that’s what was happening but that’s not what was happening and I’ve pointed out multiple times and yet I still get treated like I don’t know what I’m talking about or that I am wrong. I’m not very appreciative of the disrespect or lack of caring about making sure that the container is simply filled to where they say it should be to begin with. For the pricing that panda express charges I can certainly receive better quality and quantity both from the food and the customer appreciation elsewhere. Very disappointed to say the least.

2,pissd off customer,2019-07-09 16:03:35,1,"This app has way more stars than it deserves. I don’t know how so many people are satisfied with this completely unusable app. I cannot order anything because every time I initiate an order by setting the pickup time and place, it just loads for a long time before telling me the order could not be placed. The loading times for anything in this app are nonsensical and absurd. I have to force quit the app then open it again to start over and hopefully it doesn’t get stuck on a loading screen again. Why the hell does it take so long to continue as guest? Like wth is it processing for so long to get past the initial screen? I can’t fast log in because autofilling the email always enters my password (which is fully visible i.e. security issue) instead of my email. Even when I have the cursor on the password field, autofilling it will replace my manually entered email with my password (again, it is visible) and still leave the password field blank. Also the map to find your location almost never works and also takes forever to load. This app has all the same terrible problems as their website too.

They would’t cover my delivery fee which was absurd, I paid to have it delivered. ANYWAYS, I try to reorder on the app and it says the order couldn’t be placed because now it would be ready at a later time which was fine but it still wouldn’t go through. If you read other reviews, others have the same experience. I kept having that issue no matter what I tried on the app, so I finally went on my laptop and just ordered from their website. That’s how I ordered the first time. Tell me why, 4 ORDERS WERE MADE. 3 were from the unsuccessful attempts on the app, and 1 successful try from the website. I got three orders and then ANOTHER ONE WAS ON THE WAY. Thankfully that one was cancelled, someone must’ve figured out what happened. I didn’t call the store, pretty sure it wasn’t their fault. And during these uncertain times, I am sure there is no one to call. But yea spending so much money on Panda was not in my plans today.

I closed the app on my phone, reopened it and voila, guess what the option was added.

We would like to be able to order the food and go, because the customer service in North Miami Beach is horrible, the worst I have experience, so avoiding them through online ordering is the only way we will eat Panda Express again. FYI, we tried multiple times with different orders and cards and nothing. Come on, this 2018, update your app please.",The “place order” button does not work!!!,False,Panda Express

187,xxdanhalenxx,2020-04-19 19:22:07,2,"Well thought out ordering system, but everything lags like crazy. Took me 10 minutes to place an order for 2 plates because every time you click something, it takes 10 seconds for the app to catch up.

Now I will just trust that this is understandable since I can not even read it.. I am tipping in blind .

Now, I am using the app cause in the computer on the website was giving me an error when I was trying to submit my payment.. I was about to give up.. but hey.. i really like your orange chicken :/",I love Panda but the not the App,False,Panda Express
189,applebobbie,2020-04-10 02:53:36,1,I placed the order & got an alert they need more time before I pick up. I pushed ok and thought I was done. I went back before heading out to see my credit card info was wiped despite having saved it and order had not gone through.  I placed it again. Then got a text that door dash is delivering!store does not answer calls! Door dash said they are indeed bringing it despite my having ordered for pick up! Maybe all due to COVID but unclear!!!,Problems with the first order so far,False,Panda Express

It booted me out twice when putting my credit card info in which then I had to start over.  The pick up time kept changing, which I understand but then it made me reorder...crazy. Please change the light great information on this ordering sight to a black so it’s easily readable.  
Thank you.",Difficulty in placing order,False,Panda Express

With a new password, the app still would not log me in to my account.

I understand the shrimp is a sometimes limited time only thing, but orange chicken?  Come on. And when I call to ask, I just feel like an idiot. “It’s there, did you check here, here and here?”  Yes, yes I did. It’s not there. Yes, I’ve checked for updates for the app.  Yes, I’ve gone on the website instead. Still never has what I’m looking for.

195,Big*Spender,2020-11-30 02:30:00,1,"Either their service changed or their app broke. Either way, it is unfortunate what has happened. During a pandemic, is is nice to order your food and then wait in your car instead of in a line of people while it is prepared.

Upon arrival I find out that your don’t get the online orders for about 10 minutes after the order is placed.
