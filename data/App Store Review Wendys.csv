0,Don’t usually leave reviews..,"I’ve used a lot of these apps and while I could nitpick every one of them, I’d rather just tell you what’s most important to me: response time to feedback. 

Whenever something happens at the store, the Burger King/jack in the box apps are the least responsive, you’ll have to play email tag with them for days to weeks and might get nowhere. Jack in the box solution is to go to there stores cause they never just refund your money for a missing item or something wrong, lost out on reward points cause they made a mistake? Too Bad. 

The Wendy’s app gets you a response in 24 hours, either text/email but you get that feeling that there’s definitely one person you’re talking to and not going through a chain of command or a team. Now, what’s more important to you? Responsiveness when it comes to your money or something dumb, like a button doesn’t work or the layout doesn’t look right for you?",5,neilhatestech,2021-11-04 03:23:34,False,,Wendys
1,Good when works  but needs support,I been using this app for about a year and for the most part it works. My issues are no actual customer support for issues. I made an order and the app had no issues taking my payment but the restaurant had to close early that day. I never received my usual confirmation for picking up my order since I didn’t. I contacted customer support multiple times and never got a single response back after 2 days. Only after taking a survey did the restaurant manager reply to my survey and sent one email telling me to contact customer support for a refund. I replied saying I did and no one would respond and neither did that manager to my email. I had to initiate a charge back with my credit card company to get my refund. I was also making a lunch order in advance and after the customization the app decided to completely clear my order because it turned 10:22 AM and breakfast orders can’t be made anymore and the menu turns to lunch and why is breakfast cut for mobile ordering at 10:22 AM when the restaurant will take it until 10:30 AM? What’s up with the digital frosty key tag? I bought the physical one and it says I can use it with ANY purchase but the digital one it can NOT be used with any other offers that’s a scam. I definitely will not be visiting Wendy’s as much this year!,2,Sick-Of-Citi,2021-12-14 19:15:48,False,,Wendys
2,A bad app looks worst than no app,"For the love of god, if another food company comes out with a terrible app that they tasked an intern and a budget of $50 with to make, I’m gonna stop eating food all together. 
Your app makes the entire ordering process take longer, more frustrating, and I see zero advantages over ordering in person. If you close out a sign in dialog you must force close the app to ever have the chance to log in. The coupon process is NOT intuitive to apply.. which is crazy, because he internet has done coupons since the start, and we got it down at least 20 years ago. Just delete the app, because I know I won’t ever try it again, it only wastes time, and when it does work, I never save time. Not once. Never once. Seriously. The speed for me to read out my order into the speaker is greater than opening the app, praying you’re still signed in, praying it will let you sign back in, praying that the cart functionality won’t break requiring you to restart, praying the app doesn’t randomly close. After all that you get the “privilege” of not having to speak your order.. but I’m pretty sure searching through navigational menus just to find a specific item, spend time going through to customize it, and repeat for every single item in your order is not as fast as saying “number 6, no ketchup”",1,afitz 200,2022-02-23 23:53:58,False,,Wendys
3,Horrible App! Bad Customer Service!,"I ordered through their app and when I got to the restaurant, I was unable to check in. I kept getting an error message. I went to the front to ask them to prepare my order and to report the issue. The worker rudely stated that she couldn’t help me and called for the next customer while I was standing there. I was then told that I had to place the order with them directly and pay again. When I mentioned that I would need a refund for the mobile app order, they stated that I had to contact Wendy’s customer service for the refund and that they had nothing to do with the mobile app order. I decided to leave the restaurant and get nothing because I found them to be rude and unhelpful. When I contacted Wendy’s customer service, they told me that the manager at the store would have had to refund me and that they cannot give refunds to customers. They sent a message to the manager at the location and stated that they will contact me when they can. What does that mean? Who refunds customers when the mobile app decides to mess up. The store or Wendy’s customer service? Regardless I’m going to contact my credit card company to reverse the charge. I’ve never had this issue with any other food ordering app and I promptly deleted Wendy’s app and won’t be using it again.",1,Viozu,2021-05-12 17:00:01,False,,Wendys
4,Location,"So far the app works really well, it’s does what a mobile ordering app should do compared to some of the other ones out there, however I have to draw the line at the intensive use of my phones location services.  It’s not that I typically mind if a restaurant uses it to make ordering an easier task, my issue stems from the fact that if I have location services enabled “only when using the app” that unless I force close it the app will almost flagrantly shove in my face that it is still using my location services because at the top of my screen it’ll show the blue gps line at the top of my screen. I don’t usually make a habit of force closing my apps which is on me but I figure it would stop on its own given that my settings only allow for when Im “using the app” and Im not. It does not and It then proceeds to drain my battery and it feels a little sketchy that Im not actively using the app but your actively taking my location, even if the logical conclusion is your using it to suggest nearby restaurants. I have since changed my settings to never use my location, and hope this gets fixed in the future.",3,BurnedPheonix,2021-11-23 16:12:33,False,,Wendys
5,No good,"I used this app before today to get free delivery and waited then 30 mins later it said it was canceled.  Nice when kids are all waiting to eat lunch.  No explaination…only that it was canceled.  Called the store and they said it was canceled and blamed it on DoorDash yet I didn’t get it from doordash’s app I got it from Wendy’s app.  
Then today when trying to order my prior order and it never saved on app so I put my order in the cart randomly getting these little pop up errors (“Error We're sorry, an error was detected.”  when just going into food to edit or add, just viewing items in cart, etc.  So I decided to favorite each meal plus the whole order just to ensure I didn’t lose my order.  Then I go to add one more thing, then it cleared my entire order (6 different meals).  I went under favorites to see if they were there and nothing is there.  Ugh this thing is a pain.  Not sure how it got such good reviews.

Two more things to find menu then location and it was just spinning where it had their little food image on the screen with the bar going across repeatedly.  Also, tried to scan the item I bought and system just hung again with the little food image and bar.  It wasn’t my WiFi that was the problem either.",1,Karls S,2021-06-23 14:40:49,False,,Wendys
6,Worst Fast Food App,"I have apps for all the fast food restaurants in my area and this is the absolute worst. 
The first time I used this app I placed my order and paid and when I arrived to the restaurant to pick up my order they told me they don’t accept mobile orders. How?? Get yourself together Wendy’s. Obviously if a location is not taking mobile orders I should not have been able to place a mobile order for that location. Fortunately the staff were kind and understanding and I was able to get my meal without having to pay twice. 
Since then, I’ve been able to use this app successfully only one time. Every other time there have been errors that occur and prevent me from checking out. Today there was an offer for a free frosty with mobile order but again, the stupid app will not let me place a mobile order. I just used one of my other apps that actually work and went to a different place to eat. 
I love Wendy’s but whoever they have got to develop this app needs to be replaced ASAP. I can’t be the only one they’re losing business from. 
The only positive thing I can say is that when the app actually works it is simple to use, but I could say that for literally any other restaurant. Step it up devs.",2,Sarahf12912,2019-08-16 18:28:00,False,,Wendys
7,Ordering through the app and applying deals isn’t easy,"The app isn’t showing any stores around and after restarting the app. I just created an account and have not been able to use the offers that I installed it for. There are also apparently no Wendy’s in my area that are available for mobile ordering, so I can’t use the mobile deals either way… Reporting feedback in the app is also NOT user friendly. When I try it insists that I have to choose a time of visit and a store, but NO stores come up. So I can’t submit the form to give feedback. I just have to wait for whenever the app pops up to ask for feedback, which I haven’t seen since I first opened the app and handnt even used it yet… why would they even ask for feedback at that point. 🙄 It’s been giving me “Sorry, there was an error detected.” Which gives no confirmation that the error was reported or option to fix it. Then when I try to chat, it says I’m #1 in line, forever…
As a last resort, I logged out and deleted the app and tried again. It then wouldn’t even let me log in, giving the same “Sorry, there was an error detected” message. I give up. All other apps of all sorts, including Wendy’s competitors work fine.",1,Tealie-o,2021-12-14 15:23:37,False,,Wendys
8,Love Wendy’s,"I love Wendy’s because the French fries are the best, love the 4 for $4, love the free junior frosty with the card I purchase once a year ( I buy one for my adult son too).  I love the senior discount ( or free senior drink) and the apple pecan salad is great. I also love the grilled go wrap. I guess you could say, I love Wendy’s. As for the staff, they are always nice.  I usually eat at Wendy’s twice a week, but have been there more often than that many times.    Since you updated the app a while back, MY IPHONE 6 WILL NOT ACCEPT THE NEW APP!  I know it says that I can use an older version, but it just won’t work!!!  I NEED HELP!  I haven’t had my Wendy’s app for months!   Hoping someone will help me. I have points that I cannot access and offers l cannot see.  I haven’t found a place that says “CONTACT US”. People who work there don’t know how to fix this either.

9,"Terrible APP, Horrible Customer Service","So after waiting in the drive through line for over 45 minutes I was finally able to place my order. Then when I attempted to pay, using the mobile app, it took 10 minutes just for the attendant at the window to know how to take payment from a customer using the mobile app. The transaction failed. Apparently I needed to add funds to my Wendy account. I selected $25 dollars and then was promoted to enter my CVV number. When I did it generated an unknown error. I closed the app and restarted my phone but still had the same error. I checked my checking account balance and there was plenty to cover the charge. I called my bank and the agent said everything was good on the banks end. At this point it was clearly an issue with the Wendy’s APP. I tried the live chat option inside the app. Even though I was 1st in line to chat with a support agent I waited nearly 20 minutes but no agent ever responded to my request. I called the toll free support phone number, was told I was 5th in line but after 25 minutes I gave up. I tried their Instagram chat, it’s been 30 minutes and no response. Your APP and customer support are total crap!!",1,Steven Waters,2021-07-15 20:33:30,False,,Wendys
10,Tough app to use but does have nice food deals,"I think this app is too complicated for the average person to use.   I tried to buy a digital frosty key tag today. First I couldn’t find the offer. Then I finally found it with two options, physical card or digital. Sounds great!  However when I checked out with the digital option, I still had to go to a store to pick up the physical card. At least that’s what my store told me when I called to get them to release the digital order. They had never heard of digital key tags. Come on, Wendy’s, don’t roll stuff out without training your staff!  You need to let the digital key tag frosty offer work in addition to other deals too. Throw us a bone here! The jr frosty isn’t the deal, it should be lagniappe.  

Anyway, to anyone reading this, you have to get and use this app so Wendy’s will continue to invest in it. The app idea is good, the food hits the spot, and the deals in app bring me when I’m considering the options.  They just need to simplify it. Maybe try some more focus groups and watch people try to use it.",3,Suprajayne,2020-12-17 03:12:59,True,"{'id': 2550638, 'body': ""Hey there!

11,Mobile ordering slow customer service,I ordered on the app weeks ago and was charged almost 50 dollars for it all. Never received my drinks and didn’t get a refund for it so I had to call customer service. I sent an email and waited 4 days still haven’t heard anything back from them at that point. I grew really impatient and so I tried calling them on the phone and waited about a half hour on the phone to get in contact with someone. The guy apologized and gave me a refund for the entire order but still I will not be using the app again. When I went to the location near me they said they can not scan the free rewards and have to punch them in as a coupon. I had 500 points In rewards I’m not even able to use because I selected breakfast items and every time I try to place an order to get it they don’t have the breakfast. Breakfast should be served until 12. It’s ridiculous and the app is useless. I will be uninstalling. This app is such a inconvenience to use and not worth it. Especially when the food is mediocre. I will not be returning to Wendy’s and purchasing from them again. Every time I go I am always unsatisfied with their service.,1,honest1678,2022-02-25 17:24:52,False,,Wendys
12,Going Downhill Fast!,"This app is progressively plagued with issues. It continues to become less user friendly each time it’s redesigned. Recently, it stopped clearing out the current order after it was placed and the app closed, preventing a new order from being placed the next time the app was opened. Also more recently, selecting an available offer would make it disappear from availability without adding it to the cart. Yesterday, I was unable to process any orders at all. The app froze loading my total each time. Today, after updating the app, I was logged out and the app gives an error message “forbidden” when I try logging in, of trying to sign up fresh. Live Chat with customer service doesn’t exist anymore and there’s no email option. I don’t want to spend who knows how long it will take trying to reach someone over the phone, only to be told they can’t do anything anyway. 

I’ve now deleted this useless app. Fortunately, I have both a Carl’s Jr. and a Jack in the Box within a block of this Wendy’s, so I’ll take my business there a few times a week. Oh, also the Burger King I have closer to home. All those apps are working just fine!",1,5 minute apps,2022-03-14 01:42:32,False,,Wendys
13,Bring back mobile and BOGO offers,"We are retired and while at first it was difficult to get used to mobile ordering, we embraced it because of the good mobile offers and pandemic, necessitating drive-thru drive service.  Then they messed up the app so badly that a mobile offer couldn't be added to a mobile order and they were unwilling to help at the restaurant.  They almost lost us as costumers with that debacle, but we left without purchasing a couple of times and eventually an update fixed it.  Again we continued to frequent Wendy's at least once a week for their 2/$5 Single and spicy chicken sandwich deal, or any one of the good app offers they always had.  Now the good offers are completely gone in favor of a vastly inferior REWARDS program, and so are we.  There are many other fast food options out there that want out business and offer discounts that we will use.  The selection of coupons at this time is an absolute joke.  Bring back offers that people want or you won't have a business before long.  The so is useless if you don't offer deals that people want.",2,!BeyondFrustrated!,2020-09-01 15:25:07,False,,Wendys
14,"Asks for location, then charges you for orders at different stores","So I went to give this app a second chance today, and it asked me to allow it to always view my location. I never do this because I like to have at least some privacy these days, but I allowed it just this once, figuring if the app knows where I am then it’s less likely to get confused, right? Wrong. 
Shortly after submitting my order, I go to turn on my car to go pick it up and it won’t start, so I need to cancel my order that I can no longer pick up. Well, I open the app again to find that it believes I’m currently IN THE PARKING LOT of a store on the OTHER SIDE OF THE STATE. It then marks my order as completed and picked up, and charges my card. To make things even worse, there’s no “report a problem with this order” button like a functional app should have, so I have to wait forever in a customer service queue to get refunded for this order I never got, while figuring out what else to do for lunch, while trying to figure out what’s wrong with my car. 

Tl;dr this app STILL doesn’t work after all these months, which can make for a really bad day. Just stick with McDonald’s.",1,h3lloth3re,2021-03-23 18:39:00,False,,Wendys
15,Wendy's always disappoints,"In the past 3 years I have yet to have a ""good"" experience at any Wendy's. It makes me sad because I usually enjoy their food. They got rid of their artisan egg sandwich for breakfast. They got rid of breakfast as an option at most restaurants. They got rid of my favorite salad. Not much reason to go. I decided to try the app for the free spicy nuggets. I ordered for pickup through drive thru, and chose the one-time card payment (that doesn't save your card info). My app said PAID. When I got there, they said I needed to add money to the digital balance. While this was an option when paying, I didn't choose it. The app clearly said paid, although I got no email or any confirmation saying I paid or ordered. They were absolutely positive that I had not paid, when I indeed had. So they gave up and said they'll pay for me. Whatever. When I get back and check my bank account, there is the charge for my meal. So I was being hopeful that I actually got a free meal when, nope, they disappointed again. I'll probably be back in a year or so only to disappoint myself again. Long story short, don't bother with the mobile ordering.",1,Sum1r,2019-09-13 01:22:00,False,,Wendys
16,Needs work,"Not the most intuitive app I’ve seen. But what really annoys me is having to place my order and arrive at the restaurant eight minutes before breakfast ends. This is fast food. I don’t mind if it takes them a little while to prepare it because I know that they’re new to breakfast, but I should be able to place my order and arrive at Wendy’s before the cut off and still get it. I wasn’t able to get there eight minutes early last time although I could’ve gotten there five minutes early. Ended up going to Chick-fil-A. Arrive there at 10:26 and placed my order at that same time and got my order by 10:28 with no problems. Wendy’s food is good, but the service and app needs improvement. Update: I tried again the next day at an earlier time so I could make sure to use one of the discount codes since it was the last day it was valid. However instead of taking two dollars off my breakfast combo like it explicitly said it would, it would only take off $1.39 no matter what I tried. I did not edit the order or do anything to change the basic elements of the combo. This feels kind of like a scam.",1,Rg1234567,2020-03-15 13:08:02,False,,Wendys
17,New changes,"Dear sir (s) I would like to speak about the new changes you have included in the Wendy’s app. I’m not a favorite of the mobile pay app. It’s Incredibly easy to hack. Not just yours  mind you but all of them. Five family members accounts were hacked. Money stolen and had to get new cards from their backs. This isn’t only in CA but three different states. I also our choices of meal discounts are dwindling. More app only deals have taken over. We don’t want delivery meals, when we’re out we like a sit down experience. Apparently our choices on your app will be severely limited, or completely go to mobile order only. That, will limit our Wendy’s experience tremendously. Sorry, I know the mobile app is the new “hot idea” to drum up new business. But in our case it will do just the opposite. Good luck we do love Wendy’s “fresh” menu and freshly prepared meals (hot) hopefully our type of business won’t be excluded.",4,senor #uno the boss,2019-10-26 16:54:41,False,,Wendys
18,Terrible App,"I added money to the app so I can place my order, pay for it, and someone to pick it up since I got hurt. I placed the order and paid in the app with the $50 I put in there. My cousin went to pick it up for me and was told the payment did not went through. I told her the payment number for the app and it didn’t went through. I had to send the money to my cousin in order to repay for food already paid in the app. This happened two more times. After the second time I chatted with an agent whom saw that everything was correct on my end and sent the information and proof to management of my local Wendy’s. I was told to delete the app and reinstall it. I decided to try it a few days later to see if it worked and still did the same thing. I was checking my email constantly to see if Wendy’s management figured out the problem and no response. So now I just preorder or order at the drive thru still with my money just sitting in the app.",2,J-GMck,2022-03-09 03:14:19,False,,Wendys
19,Useless,"I have used this app about ten times now and have only actually succeeded once. It works to find stores, look at menus, etc, but DO NOT upload a gift card! I have had two gift cards now that I have uploaded and the second it is uploaded to your app, the card becomes invalid. You can no longer use the physical card, nor can you mobile pay or place a mobile order. The app also does not tell you that your payment (with said gift card) failed, so while you wait for your mobile order, thinking everything went through just fine, it isn’t even being made, bc the restaurant received an order with failed payment. Luckily the employees tend to be very helpful and apologetic, but this app really needs to be fixed. Also, if you add a reward to a mobile order that fails, you do not get the reward back to try again with different payment or to try to use in store instead of on a mobile order. This app is so frustrating.",2,RaceTrac Fanatic,2021-07-10 17:21:38,False,,Wendys
20,Getting Better with each update,The app has consistently improved. I would suggest allowing for drink customization such as lite or no ice. It would save me the trouble of having to ask when arriving for pickup and hope they didn’t already prepare the drink. It would also be great if the credit card CCV would save so we don’t have to keep entering all the time since I have sometimes left the card at home while trying to order with my default payment. One last suggestion would be to allow us to use whatever balance remains on a Wendy’s gift card. If you don’t have enough to cover the entire purchase it does not allow you to split the payment allowing for the gift card to be used up,5,McMess99,2021-05-11 23:44:12,False,,Wendys
21,Unreliable,"I liked the app until they went with the rewards program. I did delivery some. The last order was wrong and items were missing. There was no place on the app to report problems. I did send an email, but didn't receive a response. I had built up substantial rewards and decided to take advantage to purchase a salad. However, the reward points show it was to be used for a salad, but then it couldn't be applied at checkout. So the points were lost in limbo. Today I was in the mood for one of their burgers I really like. I did a pick up at the drive up. It took me 10 to 15 minutes to get there. At the order station I was told it was ready and to pull forward. There were a few cars ahead of me. Once at the pick up window I still had to wait as if I had just placed the order. Definitely no advantage to having used the app and ordering ahead. Has definitely soured me from using the app or even going there anymore.",2,Judz2,2022-03-24 07:09:27,False,,Wendys
22,"App has a lot of Glitches, Beware","I appreciate Wendy’s effort to bring a mobile app to the consumers. It has been an upgrade to their service. However, ever since the start, the app has been filled with glitches. At the beginning they were mostly minor issues. For the last 12 months, I’ve noticed major issues that drastically altered the purchasing process. 12 months ago, it was issues with pick up options. 6 month ago it was issues with the redemption of offer and reward. A few months ago, they had issues with service speed. It seemed like the store does not get the order ahead, and only starting making the food after the guest has physically arrived today, even when they are not busy. As of today, there is a network issue and the app can’t send the order in. I had to go to the fast food place next door. Just wanted future guests of Wendy’s know to check the app and plan ahead before it’s too late in case they have an ongoing glitch.",1,TX Machine,2021-12-07 18:35:48,False,,Wendys
23,Beware of Mobile Order,"Wow, I order via mobile for so many restaurants but will never do so again with this app.  Placed a mobile
Order for inside pickup.  When I arrived, parked in the designated spot and d I was there.  The app told me to go to the counter and pick up the order.  Unfortunately the restaurant had a sign on the door that they were drive thru only.  I called the restaurant and they told me to get in the very long double drive thru line.  I did not have time to do that which is why I ordered for mobile pickup.  Since I had paid already, I asked the order be cancelled and I tried to call customer service.  After waiting on hold for almost 20 minutes I emailed them and have yet to hear back. I completely understand staffing issues, but the app should be as smart as all of the others out there and not allow me to place the order for pick up inside. Wendy’s, I expect better from you.  Do not recommend this app!",2,ElectronicNewbie,2021-11-03 16:43:57,False,,Wendys
24,Probably the worst “fast” food app!,"If you are willing to spend quite a bit of time fighting an app to order and pay for your food, then this should meet your needs; otherwise, it’s a painful experience.  I gave it 2 stars because you can get an order to go through if you persevere!  The fact that it requires you to load funds into your account in order to pay means you have “dead funds” sitting there and cannot access them without adding funds.  The app doesn’t accept Apple Pay, and, when you FINALLY get an order submitted, your reward at the restaurant is generally a disappointment of a super thin sliced lousy tomato (was it really there?!), a partial ring or two of thin sliced onion, a partial lettuce leaf to go with a reheated burger patty and reheated fries!  I have fond memories of Wendy’s, and, once in a while, nostalgia and hunger overtake my better judgment.

25,Worthless,"I have no idea if the app is good or not because apparently there isn’t a password that’s good enough for me to use to order fast food. I tried so many crazy passwords and each time fulfilled all of the listed requirements, double and triple checked to make sure I had everything required and each time was told what I chose wouldn’t work. So that’s why this app is “worthless” to me because I literally cannot use it. I’ve tried contacting them, no response, I tried deleting the app and downloading it again, and nothing has worked so far. Several of the closest Wendy’s to me are only taking mobile orders because of staffing issues so this app being completely useless has kept me from eating at Wendy’s for months. It’s frustrating and the only reason I’m writing this review is in hopes that maybe, just maybe someone with the company will read it and contact me or resolve the issue, but seeing as how I’ve e-mailed them several times with no response I highly doubt it.",1,Adamtheadult,2021-11-21 22:40:30,False,,Wendys

Yep, after the last update, the app starts up, then flashes the Wendy’s ads (it’s good at doing that tho) then quits back to the main iPhone home screen. I’ve got tons of free available memory and space and no other apps running at the time. The only workaround I’ve found was to shut down and reboot the phone, then wait,…a while…, and try again to navigate back to the spot I was just in. Hyper annoying when the app unexpectedly quits and you’re suddenly cold caught on the spot having to shut down and reboot your phone while drivers behind you start laying on their horn while you’re struggling with the app at the Drive-Thru Speaker is Definitely cringe tier!

27,At least you can pay through it,"Customizing items is incredibly difficult, and there is no option to customize drinks (do you want no ice? Too bad.). There are coupons available solely through the mobile app, but those aren’t the same coupons that are available in the mailers, so don’t get too attached to the physical coupon you have. They don’t start processing the order until you get to the drive through window, so if you have a slow location, you won’t save any time. But the one benefit: you can pay wirelessly, so you don’t have to hand over your card.
EDIT: Docking a star because ever since viewing the breakfast menu one time, I can no longer see anything BUT the breakfast menu, at any time of day. My favorites are thankfully still there, but that’s all I can add from the lunch menu. Perhaps reinstalling will fix it, but I honestly don’t think the app is worth it, especially when it’s deals are so much worse than the mailer ones.",1,ThinePwnage,2020-10-30 18:04:40,False,,Wendys
28,Please add Apple Pay Support,"Anecdotally, while I used to run into bugs semi-frequently, it now feels more stable than previous versions. The app itself is decent, but could use some improvements:

1) Lacks Apple Pay support
Not only is this a huge inconvenience factor, but for me, the biggest appeal of Apple Pay is security. With Apple Pay, I don’t have to give out my credit card number to 3rd parties and worry that they’ll get hacked. Also, the Apple Pay double cash back for Apple Card users does influence where I order more frequently. 

2) UX for Offers 
When applying an offer, it would be more convenient if the app automatically combined the process of adding the offer together with the process for ordering items related to the offer. For example, if the offer is “$1 off large fries”, adding the offer should be combined with the step of adding the large fries to the order (and also the opportunity to customize). The mobile ordering experience has to be as streamlined as possible, or else you risk having it feel like an inconvenience, when you are actually trying to make it more convenient. 

3) Sign In with Apple
Not as important as Apple Pay, but definitely another major convenience for Apple users. Saves me the hassle of having to create new accounts.",3,up_on_the_ladder,2020-06-29 17:56:58,False,,Wendys
29,Steals money,"I used to order through the app with no issues but the past 2 times I ordered the order got cancelled and it charged me!!!! The first time I ordered but it glitched out when I clicked check out so I ordered again and it did the same thing. I didn’t think much of it but then I checked my bank statement and I got charged TWICE without receiving food. I contacted customer service multiple times in multiple ways with NO response.  I ordered again today thinking it was just a glitch and it wouldn’t happen again, I was wrong. I ordered but then I realized I ordered at the wrong location so I simply edited my order and changed the location. This time I got my food and had no issues with that but then when I checked my bank statement I realized I got charged TWICE! Mind you these 2 times were about a month apart. You’d think they’d fix the problem but apparently they didn’t. Is this even legal?? Seriously they have the worst customer service ever.",1,aguzman103,2021-07-30 22:35:24,False,,Wendys
30,Good overall,"I generally like to use mobile ordering because it allows me to look at the menu with any pressure of the employee in the drive through window or other patrons waiting on me and I can confirm the accuracy of my order. Especially with the pandemic, it’s been great. This app paired with Wendy’s seeming to put more effort into the quality of their food in the past year has made Wendy’s one of our go-to places for takeout. Recently, I have been getting repeated emails telling me I never finished placing an order. This seems to occur the morning following my last mobile order. I open the app, and see nothing waiting to be submitted in my bag. This appears to be a glitch on Wendy’s end, and while not a huge deal, it is a minor annoyance.",4,Lord Aronsworth,2021-12-22 12:06:36,False,,Wendys
31,Useless,"I’m not the type to leave reviews but this app has been completely useless and a huge waste of my time. I first started by trying to simply order breakfast. I added my items and got the check out page where it got stuck in an endless loop of loading my pickup method and payment method, would not show my total and would not let me checkout. I completely reinstalled the app, tried wifi and cellular data, still nothing. I thought okay I’ll just try to use one of the discount offers at the restaurant. Can’t forget to mention the discount offers are hidden in the rewards store, as compared to other apps that feature them on the front page. I get to the restaurant and conveniently the app shows that there are suddenly no offers available even though there were plenty 10 minutes ago when I was looking from my house. Again, reinstalled, tried both wifi and data, still no offers showed up. USELESS!",1,Gdgufhh,2021-04-21 12:49:18,False,,Wendys
32,Lost My Account After Several Issues,"This app is probably one of the worst restaurant apps out there. I had it for about a year and it was manageable at first, but then the issues came rolling in. First is a complete disconnect between the app and the store locations. A few times I ordered “in store pickup” because the app said it was available, but when I arrived the doors were locked and angry employees yelled at me for a mistake the app made (customer service is so shoddy at Wendy’s but that’s a different topic). Then came the coupon offers. Sometimes I couldn’t redeem them but the times that I could, it wouldn’t apply at checkout. Frustrating when the app sends you notifications about these offers but doesn’t let you use them. The final nail in the coffin was when it logged me out and when I tried to log in again it said my account didn’t exist. Bottom line, don’t touch this app with a ten foot pole, there are better places to eat anyways.",1,CBKing24,2022-03-03 19:51:58,False,,Wendys
33,Horrible company,This is by worse app / company ever dealt with and it’s sad because there food is great the people in the restaurants are very rude especially during covid times... then when trying to send in a formal complaint the customer service constantly hangs up on you. Had to use the rewards and it does not state when using rewards you have to make a purchase well yea the employees tell you that you have to make a purchase because the rewards are like a coupon but it does not state it on the coupon and because they uploaded it into the system they said I’m not getting my rewards back this is upsetting as a company they are vary unprofessional especially the employees who work for the company countless times they are rude to so many people and no one can complain because once you call to complain they hang up on you.

34,Needs a LOT of work,"First - why can’t I store my payment method in the app like everyone else allows?  I mean, you can sorta store it, but it wants the CVV number everytime you place an order.  

Second - the app apparently isn’t in tune with what’s available at the store.  I placed an order for a burger and a side of chili.  The order went thru and my card was charged immediately.  I get to the window to be told they were out of chili.  I asked them how they were going to handle this, as I had already been charged.  They told me they would take it off the order and credit my card.  I had my doubts, but they must know, right?  Well, it’s been well over a week and of course, no credit.  I checked the app just to see if the credit was there.  No credit.

35,Stole my money,"I’ve been using the app without issues. Grandkids love Wendy’s so it was nice to have it delivered to them during quarantine or preorder and have it brought to the car. 
I don’t like the idea of my debit card being saved on the app and , at the time, they didn’t have Apple Pay, so I had money loaded to Wendy’s app.  Everything was great. I had a ton of reward points that I could never redeem and a little less than $20 in the app for paying. 
On 2/15 I opened the app to place an order and EVERYTHING IS GONE! Idk if they updated the app or what but it was treating me like we’d just met. Forgotten was the 1-2 x’s weekly use. I felt like I had been pretty faithful over the last couple of years. I didn’t use any other ff apps. And how am I treated? Swipe left, you never existed. 
And yes. I feel as though this is a bad breakup. Wendy’s cs disconnects me. No response to text or emails. And took my money. How do I prove there was still a balance when they deleted my account? 
That’s a pretty poorly thought out update. Or is it? I’m pretty sure I’m not the only one so I guess they made out with the money they stole. 
Idc about the reward points since they were impossible to redeem anyway. But TAKING MY MONEY IS A WHOLE LOT DIFFERENT!
You won’t be seeing me in their drive through again that’s for sure. Even if they didn’t finally add Apple Pay.",1,ttloper,2022-02-27 20:16:55,False,,Wendys
36,Never Again,"On Friday I put an order for pick-up in on the app. First the reward did not work causing me to be charged full price for an item that was supposed to be $1. Second when I got to the Wendy’s #9078 to pick up my order they were closed. I went to the drive-thru window and was cursed at by the worker to get out of the drive-thru, the manager then came over and said there was nothing they could do about it and to contact the app for a refund. I attempted to chat with customer service on the app to no answer, called the phone number on the app to no answer, sent an email to no answer as of three days later. Luckily my credit card company was able to cancel the transaction due to the fraudulent service. I will never use the Wendy’s app again nor go to a Wendy’s restaurant again.

I know some folks had trouble but it worked spectacular for me; until the last update screwed this app up so bad you can’t use it; and I have no intention of ever doing so for anything more than removing my card, should I ever be able to log on again. Was placing an order; finished and went to cart; boom app crashes. Get it to reload, it shows 3 items in cart, but when you click on it, it wants to submit it, but will not let me see or review any item. I have no idea what’s being ordered. So I delete and reinstall; now my password and log in doesn’t work, even though it’s thumb print enabled and it’s saved to my phone!!!! Try reset password, emails never come.

When I got to the drive through window to pick up my order, I was told that they have no record off my order. I showed the manager the pending Wendy’s charge on my cre”dit card activity on my phone. She just shrugged and repeated that they had no order, so I left without the food that i had ordered and paid for. My order history on the app also does not show the order at all, so I’m 100% sure I did not inadvertently place the order at another store. However, but my card was charged. I don’t have the time to  spend talking with Wendy’s Customer Service to try and get a $6.50 refund, so in future I’ll just avoid both Wendy’s and their app. I would definitely recommend steering well clear of Wendy’s app which has not been fully tested and is not ready for prime time.",1,Dirk de Vos,2021-03-30 15:51:41,False,,Wendys

Been using app for a long time to order lettuce wrap to replace bread bun, they removed that option and only let you add a slice of lettuce… ummm I want the lettuce on both sides of the sandwich not just the bottom part. Who changed this and why? Even in the store now the employees look confused and don’t know how to put a piece of lettuce on both sides of the burger, now they only put a slice of lettuce on the bottom of the burger, what good is that? When you put the option to “ADD lettuce as a bun” again then I will change my review and when you also train staff around the world how to add 2 pieces of lettuce again instead of one piece I’ll give a better review, staff somehow forgot what add lettuce as a bun means, I guess we can blame the pandemic for making everybody forget simple easy things, it’s really rough out there guys!",1,Keithy21,2021-12-19 22:37:26,False,,Wendys
40,The best fast food app,"With all the other fast food apps they have so many broken aspects. Not to name names, but others won’t let you add payment, won’t select a restaurant if you aren’t close enough, menu glitches, etc. Wendy’s has constructed a fully functional easy to use food app with great offers and reward systems. You can order food way ahead of time. If you don’t show up you get refunded on your digital account. I only use the app since I collect points every time and if you save long enough you can get top menu items. They give you a bunch of offers for free saving $10 in several trips. Really great.

41,Buggy & some options unavailable or hard to find,"App looks nice and generally functions well. There is currently a bug I am experiencing where it does not show me what I have in my bag/cart, only the total. I recently tried to place an order and it only showed me my total, which was much higher than it should have been. I suspect this is because it had saved the previous order I had in progress, but I couldn't delete my previous items, again, because it didn't show me the items I had in my bag. Force closing and reopening the app did not fix it.

Additionally, it is not intuitive with regard to how to find customization options (e.g. no tomato on this burger), and customization isn't even available for drinks (e.g. no ice). There's also no notes section as a workaround.

For these reasons there is no reason for me to continue using the app.",2,Jaleiely,2020-06-10 19:13:16,False,,Wendys
42,Wendy’s Gimmick 💀,"First, lets talk about the fact that every time you open the app, you are immediately stricken with a terms & policy agreement.  You cannot proceed further if you do not agree.  Never agree to something where you do not know the terms; that’s stupid.  Second, the app is slow and wastes time.  It’s dumbed down with an animation of a Frostee, that gets annoying after a while because he’ll interfere with your order until you at least hit the close ‘X’ button twice.  Finally, and this is probably my biggest gripe..the orders DO NOT even register half the time!  This can easily lead to a confrontation at the drive-thru window, where people are getting angry for no reason at all.  Utterly preposterous the way I’ve seen some local Wendy chains being run.  Other places are worse however, but this is the real gimmick behind the reward system.  Gotta keep pushin’ out the trash. Enjoy the ‘food’. ☠️",1,romanumeralz,2022-01-05 15:32:14,False,,Wendys
43,Lots of free food!! App isn’t user friendly,"Took a few try’s to get the hang of it. For example if you want a Diet Coke you have to hit the coke freestyle button to find it, otherwise it just looks like you can only order lemonade. I had no idea what freestyle was-it’s a bunch more options!  Please add an option for ice preferences on drinks. I prefer no ice. Thanks!

One more issue-it took me quite a while to figure out how to use the rewards. I thought that just by adding the rewards I would get the item. Instead you must also add the item. I lost quite a few rewards this way because it deducted the reward even without adding the item. :(

Love that I can choose curbside! Even if you don’t order through the app you can open it when paying & have the barcode scanned for points.",3,Mommysarah,2021-07-16 18:57:54,False,,Wendys

It’s ridiculously touchy as it used to work great with loading funds and letting me pre order now it stopped and it won’t let me use rewards even with over 900 points. The restaurants don’t have any ability to help and when you call app support they don’t know what to do either. They ask you your account info and reset it for you then say make sure you have the most up to date version. I do and I have deleted and reinstalled the app many times and logged out and logged back in and changed the credit card on file and even with plenty of money available it won’t let me use the card.

I went by wendys order my food, offer and keychain frosty. Got to the window said I didnt have my card but was using mobile and ask if it would work. Lady wasnt sure. It took my offer coupon (great), my remaining gift card balance (great) but did not take the remaining balance from the card (bad).

So I clicked on forgot my password and waited basically an eternity for no email to show up and give me an option to change my password. Not loving the app so far.

Not only does it flat out not work but no matter what I’ve tried in order to get credit for my purchased doesn’t work either. Really disappointed because Wendy’s used to be my favorite but they need to update and figure out why their stores are going downhill. All of the Wendy's around me are full of slackers and people who don’t do a very good job at representing Wendy’s. Really stunned at the fact that the corporation is slacking and allowing their stores to become utter trash. Glad I have a Chick-fil-A in the area because I will no longer go to Wendy’s due to the poor service and no help whatsoever on the app by employees.

52,"App does not Match store menu, no customer service","Trigger warning - this review will be upsetting to anyone who likes getting what they pay for and doesn’t think they should have to spend hours of their life to get a refund when a company screws up. 

My experience illuminates a bunch of reasons not to use this app. I can only assume there are more. 

1. I ordered a pub burger but the store couldn’t make it. They charged me before the store told me they couldn’t make it. The store   could not reverse or refund the charge. 

2. There is no way in the app to dispute a charge or request a refund on a particular order. 

3. I called the number from the app and was on hold for over an hour and a half before I was finally told I would get a refund in 7-10 days.  

4. I had not gotten the refund 14 days later so I tried the online feedback/complaint form. Two more weeks later and I have never received acknowledgement of that, much less a refund, much less an apology. 

Look, mistakes happen. That’s why companies have and need legit customer service.

I was rightfully not happy at this point. After almost an hour the manager Kevin told us they were kind of busy today. I told him to give me my money back. He gave it to someone else to give to me.

Don’t care for any of your salads but I order the one that’s easiest to take off all the nasty fruit that you think needs to be on a salad!

I did not want the alternatives offered and asked if they could remove it. I was informed that they had no control over the mobile order! So I saw the cancel option and decided to cancel the order all together. To this day, almost 30 days ago. I have not received a refund from my cancelled order that I did not pick up. As well as I’ve tried to contact support from this app multiple times and no one bothers to respond or anything! The chat doesn’t even queue you to a rep.

You can pick it up inside or around the pick up window.  You can scan the app from the window during pick up to accrue points from purchases you mak. Doesn’t take a long time to get a “treat” from Wendy’s. Loveto get the surprise texts that offer discounts or little treats.

I explained I had paid through the app and they did not understand—I was told the app didn’t actually charge for orders and you still had to pay.
So today I’m disputing the expected double charge on my credit card.
Wendy’s also doesn’t have a mobile order parking spot option so you end up having to get in the same long lines to either go through the drive through or coming inside anyway; kind of defeats the purpose of mobile ordering. 🤷🏻‍♀️",4,JenniferLaurenS484,2020-11-01 17:15:07,False,,Wendys
64,Good but could be great!,"Where are the ‘offers’ in the new update? Did you guys remove coupons from the updated app?? I can’t find them. 

I like the Wendy’s app, but some basic improvements could make it even better. 

One, let people save more than one credit card in their payments without making them type the whole number out, to streamline the mobile ordering process. Currently, you’re only able to save one card. 

Second, let there be a way to distinguish between personal and door dash orders. The way it is now, every mobile order that comes through on the app looks like a door dash order to staff, and stickers are placed on bags and drinks to deter tampering. Super annoying if it’s your own food on a personal order. 

And third, I think just a little place at the bottom of the order for ‘notes’ I think would be very helpful. Here customers could make requests for things that aren’t a menu item on the app, like extra napkins or light ice in their drinks. 

Just a couple suggestions :D",4,sirfartzalot711,2021-11-26 16:00:33,False,,Wendys

Additionally, the total like was $15 off (not that I could complete my order). So instead of being able to use my offers and rewards points we needed up having to pay full price and have an absolutely miserable experience with the app. This has NOTHING to do with the location (they are great!) and everything to do with this misleading and broken app.

First of all, why 10:22? When I look it up it says 10:30 is when breakfast ends...So I rush up to Wendy’s (I live about 5min away) drive up to the speaker and say I’m picking up my mobile order but apparently the app auto cancels it after 10:22 even though it said I paid and wouldn’t let me manually cancel before leaving the house...Needless to say I’ve given up on Wendy’s breakfast.

There’s nothing we can do if it doesn’t show up.” It went back and forth with some claim how being in the store when you click pay is a problem; But I have seven kids here hungry and I paid; But that’s the app—it’s outsourced, nothing Wendy’s can do; But I’m a customer (who paid), and they’re all Wendy’s to me...

Then, for some reason, it removes the “no” from the default dressing. Therefore, the location always thinks I want two different types of dressing - the default that I can’t get rid of and the one I actually want.

So I go directly to the store and let the cashier know I’m having trouble with the app. Of course, she can’t fix it, and it seems as if she’s heard those complaints before.

It SHOULD have just chicken and lettuce at this point on it.
Then it said ‘sauces’. I figured since I took the mayo off, I could dip it in honey mustard or ranch.
WELL. It came as a bun, chicken, and both sauces... smothered on top of it.
I Don’t know if it was just less than logical people running running the prep thinking that would be a great idea or if the app is so misconstrued that I actually asked for that compared to sauce packets...

I have completely closed the app and opened it again, I have emptied the cart and started over, I have deleted the app and re downloaded and just keeps saying an error has occurred. This has been going on for at least a month maybe longer. I know I go there a lot less because of it and I am sure other people do too.

97,Bug,"After the recent update, I cant use the app unless I go under terms and conditions and re-route to the menu. I use custom DNS and I don’t know if that’s the reason for app not to function properly. Secondly, once you place the order and order hasn’t been picked up and you want to place the 2nd order, there is no way to do it since the system waits for 1st order to be picked up. That’s a sucky since I was trying to order more before I can pick up my order but there is no way to do it. I tried using web browser and it also directed me to All set! We have got your order.

Today I logged out to to see if logging back in would fix the issue, and I get errors when trying to log back in. Haven’t been able to log back in at all. 
Customer support on the app is a joke. No one ever answers the live chat, you will be 1st in line for 15-20 mins waiting for an agent who never answers.
Trying to email contact us will only allow you to make a complaint or inquiry against a particular store.

Plus, special offers added on with order don’t show on restaurant worker’s receipt print outs either. That’s now, two free sandwiches Wendy’s owes me from Special Offers on this lousy app. And anytime I place an order on this app, next day they send me a remind notice to add a Special Offer to what I order.

Just one other feature would make my Wendy’s life complete. Please add an option to get receipts for app orders emailed to me instead of printed. C’mon, help save the environment by creating less paper waste. Love ya Wendy’s!",5,bluecruiser,2021-04-22 23:42:38,False,,Wendys
101,Needs Development,"This app has a lot of potential to be great, but it’s the lack of basic functionality that makes it very frustrating for the end user. Some examples: utilizing coupons/reward codes is a nightmare. You add the coupon and sometimes it doesn’t “stick” to the order and you have to go back to the rewards page to add it. When loading checkout screen, I waited 2mins, gave up, went to the previous screen and order didn’t persist, had to restart. Upcharges on sizes aren’t presented until checkout and it’s not itemized. Ice cannot be removed from drink (basic function cmon!) 

There is a pop up every time I open the app asking me if I want a walkthrough of how to use the rewards tab.

102,Avoid this app at all costs,"I have been to Wendy’s before. Was very excited to try their new app. Had high expectations for it. Was hoping it would stand out ahead of their competitors. As a result it is set up for failure. Their deals of either free fries, $1 nuggets or other specialties with the app is false advertisement so don’t count on it, the app will not allow you to process. In terms of upgrading meals, the app kept freezing up. When you also go to pay on the app, expect the app to charge your bank or credit card twice without notice. So hopefully you have bank notifications to immediately catch it. As for pickup, only expect drive through, do not count on pickup inside at all.

My problem with that is I cannot transfer the money back to my card.I also  ran into a problem previously maybe a couple months ago, where I was at lunch with coworkers and so happen to get my app scanned to collect all the points and the next day they were all gone.

Then the app got “updated” ..... and never worked again. I’ll put stuff in my bag only to find that it has “errors”. I thought it was just my store until I tried to use it at a different location. Also, when I applied my reward it took the points.... even though I wasn’t actually able to place the order. I’ve waited for the bug to be fixed, but it hasn’t.

When I got to the restaurant I was told there was no record of my order, and they couldn’t issue a refund since there was no record of the order. They told me I had to contact customer service. Fine. I then contacted Wendy’s customer service through text since I’d have a record of the conversation. 

I was told after several chats with multiple agents that someone from the restaurant would contact me to issue a refund. I waited a week. Crickets. Then went through the process again. It’s been over a month now. Garbage service and a garbage app. I won’t be supporting Wendy’s in the future.",1,malf84,2020-10-04 16:57:51,False,,Wendys

At most other food places, like Chick-fil-A, Starbucks and even Cheddars and Old Chicago, you can save your points and then get almost an entire order at no cost… I have 1400+ points but can only use one reward at a time so I use 450 for a sandwich and still pay $20+ dollars for breakfast w my kids.

Once I ordered at around 9 p.m. and asked my cousin to pick it up from the location by my house. It wasn’t until about 10 when he called telling me they didn’t have my order so he just bought the food. I checked my app and realized I selected the wrong location. I changed it to the right location just like it says you can. When I checked it again it was after 11. Wendy’s closes at 11 so my order disappeared and my money was never refurbished to my card. I am very disappointed with Wendy’s.,3,Honeey 🍯,2020-01-19 20:17:24,False,,Wendys
108,Bad Service,"A few weeks ago I placed a delivery order through the app. When the food arrived (an hour later than estimated) the name on the receipt was correct, but nothing that I ordered was delivered. It seemed like my order got mixed up with someone else’s. It didn’t bother me that the order was wrong, I know stuff happens, mistakes happen. But when I tried to get in touch with customer service to get a refund or credit I couldn’t get in touch with anyone. I tried the chat feature, text, called and even left feedback on their website and still no answer after days of trying.

109,Will be good when and if it ever works,The app works well and seems user friendly. It is only going to succeed if there is a seamless integration with the way the stores are run. I placed my first app order for curbside pickup at my local Wendy’s. Clicked on “I’m here” when I arrived at the store. After 20 minutes or so I entered the store to inquire as to my order. The employee I spoke to walked over to the register and pulled out my order. I’m guessing she then put my order in back of all the drive through orders already in progress because I waited at least another 15 minutes for my order. No apology or explanation. Overall not a good first app experience right off the bat.,2,left wing nut job,2021-02-15 20:43:29,False,,Wendys

The time kept extending longer and longer and eventually I called the number for the driver and he said his DoorDash app had crashed. I went to the restaurant to try and just pick it ok after over an hour of waiting and they had never even received the order. But here I am, still out the money AND the rewards points I used on the order. Now I am trying to get help on the support function of the app and it just sits and spins even though it says I am first in line.

111,Only one nit to pick,"I love being able to order our food while my husband drives us to the drive-thru, and I love being able to use Apple Pay to pay for it. 

What I don’t like is that after we’ve been and gone, the Wendy’s app still shows that the drive thru is waiting for us to come pick up our food. The food that we already picked up and ate.  It even suggests there’s time to change my order. Even though the order was placed yesterday, picked up and consumed.

It’s annoying that every time I launch the app, I have to struggle for 5 minutes to get last time’s order to go away so I can start placing this time’s order.  

Once the order is placed everything works like a charm, until I get ready on another day to place another order. Then I have to go thru the whole cancel and poke and guess process to get the new order started.",4,Pumasalad,2022-03-16 21:59:13,False,,Wendys
112,Only good for one specific thing.,"The app is only good for placing an order on a good sunshiny day. Not literally, of course, but there’s only one use-case that it works for.

If you need to look up nutrition information for breakfast baconator, good luck. I’ve given up trying. Did I check all the products, no. Maybe it works 90%, but if it doesn’t work for the one thing I need it for, then it works 0%.

The second thing that happened, out of three uses of the app, was that I placed an order, drove 7 minutes to the store to find it closed. Why would it even take the order? I should’ve known there was a problem when it hung up on payment, but I thought it was just being slow. 

Given it worked one out of three times perhaps I should’ve rated it a two instead of a one, but it deserves a one for being such a stupid design. Given it worked one out of three times perhaps I should’ve rated it a two instead of a one, but it deserves a one for being so poorly designed.

113,Wendy’s you need some improvements.,"I love Wendy’s, the food and the prices. What I don’t love is this app. No option to use Google Pay or Apple Pay. Also, restaurants need to communicate better with this App. It seems like every time I place an order on this App, the employees look at me like I have 3 heads. Also, this is a major issue. When I place an order to be picked up in Drive-Thru, please don’t ask the Customer to come inside to receive their order. When they insist on that, I kindly tell them to cancel my App order and I will just order at the speaker. Come on Wendy’s. Get it together. If this doesn’t improve, I will just keep going to Chick-Fil-A. I’m so tired of rude employees at restaurants. This is in North Carolina.",1,JanSport40,2022-02-08 02:50:42,False,,Wendys

Every time I open the app I have less points, now 613, even though the app says none are recently expired and the next expiration is in 9 months. I tried contacting Wendy’s support via live chat (on a Thursday afternoon) but closed it after being #1 on line for 20 minutes. I called the contact number (same day/time), but no agent picked up after 30 minutes. I tried using the contact form, but it is only for inquiries about a specific location’s service or food, not the rewards program.

When I arrived the drive through had a hand made sign said closing at 8 pm. I drove around to the window and saw somebody inside. The lady opened the window and said they were currently closed. I said the app says 10 and I had paid for the meal. Before I could ask how to go about getting a refund on the order she yelled “Do you two want an application because we do not have enough help to stay open.” And slammed the window closed. I’m publicly apologizing if I sounded snarky in my comment about the app. But, I would be fired from my job immediately if I EVER spoke to a customer like that.",1,AJK52,2021-06-09 02:51:20,False,,Wendys

They give me a link to follow to give credit but it only works if it’s been within 24 hours of purchase. This link is not within the app but a separate one.  Beyond that they say they can do nothing.

Frustrating, especially when changing a few things. 

Also, a suggestion to allow choosing “no ice” for drinks. I always have to request it at the window. Don’t want watery drinks by the time I get home.",3,Fdgtbvdv,2021-11-29 03:10:59,False,,Wendys

I just placed my first delivery order. The ETA was only 19 minutes, which makes me skeptical. I’m cautiously optimistic, but expecting it to be late. 

I am happy that you offer Salads that are gluten free (at least the Southwest Avacado Chicken salad is). And I am grateful that your fries are gluten free.

125,Glitchy,"The app crashes constantly and with the latest update won’t allow you to find locations, do mobile ordering, or anything else. The only thing it says is error. 

It’s a sad disappointment of an app. I’ve tried for a full year to “love” this app and get it to work. It’s worked a total of six, yes only 6 times out of 50+ attempts.  I deleted it twice in the past week and re-downloaded it trying to get it to work to no avail. 

It’s also unnecessarily complicated. It’s hard to get a deal loaded into the app for use. On top of that you can’t really navigate backwards to change an order when your child decides they want nuggets instead of a burger. The app doesn’t work well with in-store interfaces and can crash the restaurant’s computers. 

Please fix the glitches. Make it easier for newbies and those that use the app regularly.  Please install a back button so you can easily change an order when your kid changes their mind.

Not contact the driver, or the restaurant, or even see where the driver is, let alone get a refund. 

Maybe you'll have better luck through the pickup feature, but delivery leaves much to be desired (like my food, which again I never got and have no idea where it ended up).",1,Pole dancer 66,2021-02-26 18:48:55,False,,Wendys

I think the app could also benefit from an arrival time specification, similar to the sonic app, so I could go ahead and order now for my food to be ready an hour from now.

Basically totally ignored me, militantly tried to give me the wrong order insisting it was right. The staff wasn’t trying to solve the problem or even listen, just get rid of me. Finally I got it across to them that it wouldn’t let me check in (yes right address) so she told me I didn’t pay for the wrong food I was holding.

The person at the drive through’s recommendation? I contact the app for a refund since the restaurant and app are completely separate things.

I selected a local Wendy’s, but it just froze in place and I had to redo it all over. The simplest function, taking my order, failed 4 times. Every time my bag would just end up being empty when looking to add additional orders. Then to top it all off, none of the offers actually work. Each time I try to apply it, it would also just reset the order with the coupon never showing up on the payment screen.

Whether it’s the abundant error codes that it throws in your face, to the constant deleting of your order before you can finalize your purchase, this app has made me rethink even going to a Wendys.

I recently got a gift card to Wendy’s and figured a chicken sandwich sounded good. I loaded the gift card onto my Wendy’s digital account and proceeded to try to complete a mobile order.

After searching their menu, the app crashed. 

Then on restart it wouldn’t show the ‘add to bag’ option.

Then another restart, it shows the ‘add to bag’ option, but when you get to checkout, it deletes your entire bag.

Finally, I restart the app a 3rd time and it proceeds to count all my previous orders at the top right, but it won’t let me check out and spews error codes at me saying it can’t view my order.

Either keep an older version of your app for those that don’t upgrade to the best phones out there, or allow ordering on your website with my account and my rewards and any deals that are listed on the app.
I doubt if these suggestions will happen, because the upper management isn’t smart enough to realize that they are alienating many of their customers, and losing them because of this issue.

The worst thing is the actual location can’t do anything about the orders and can’t give refunds for the mistakes that occurred. I was told I would have to call and cancel it myself, but the offices are closed, so I was charged for food that I wasn’t given and the location does nothing to help.

1) Mobile orders and payment have gone through fine for me.

Cons:
1) Most importantly, the app needs to allow you to remotely check-in. Putting in a mobile order, but still having to wait 15-30 minutes after “checking-in” at the restaurant completely negates the use of the application. Why would I order ahead just so I can wait the same amount of time?!?!?! Makes zero sense. For large orders this is a no brained. Multiple times I have presented ahead and my order gets “prepared fresh.” Great, by I ordered ahead so I didn’t have to wait in the parking lot for someone to bring my food out to me.

179,This app is horrible !!,"I had got a free breakfast sandwich from a app and applied it to an order but still had to pay for delivery, so after a while I get a call from my deliver saying that when he went into the Wendy’s they said my order didn’t say what I order so he tried to text customer support and they said that they would cancel my order and i fine with that until my money never came back into my account and after a few days they complete my transaction for food that I never got but honestly I could press charges or make a complaint but I hope this can be resolved easily",1,a microwave on 2'a,2021-12-21 19:47:32,False,,Wendys
180,Something not working right,"I
Paid for my order on mobile pay but the restaurant said they didn’t have the order. I have the receipt but did not get the food.  I tried calling 888 number but was placed on hold and never got an answer. Was the amount for today deducted from my digital account? So I used the offer, have receipt but received no food.",5,surelyadeal,2022-01-20 01:59:55,False,,Wendys
181,Garbage,"First the app says would you like to open me with your finger print?. Of course that doesn’t work as is so often the case, so I enter my passcode which then asks me if I want to use my saved password for Wendy’s but the saved password doesn’t work. So I chose the password reset option. I then go to my e mail and the reset link doesn’t work (but the link to Wendy’s.com in the e mail works just fine). Now who is going to continue to put up with this much trouble from an app he uses on an infrequent basis? Not me! You’ve lost sales from me. Do you folks actually test your apps? Like the way your customers use them?",1,WRJjr,2021-08-09 00:39:05,False,,Wendys
182,Major failure!!!,"I would rather give no stars. T-Mobile prompted me to get the app to use a T-Mobile Tuesday reward.  The Wendy’s app is a complete failure. Can’t even set up a new account without issues. Tried with a different email to give it another chance—no luck.  Tried the actual website for Wendy’s hoping to make a “Rewards” account that way and then log in via the app. The website doesn’t even work properly.  I get that Wendy’s is in the food business; not IT, but if you are going to offer modern tech options hire someone capable of making it function correctly (or at least function at all).",1,X-ray Lou,2021-06-22 17:40:13,False,,Wendys
183,Don’t waste your time,"It doesn’t work. You can input your order just fine, but good luck getting it to accept your payment. I’ve tried to submit orders over a dozen different times. Once... ONCE it actually went through. I use apps to place orders for my work crew almost daily. Only get this app if you want to spend a lot of time inputting the order and then never being able to actually place the order. Don’t worry with uninstalling and reinstalling the app. That doesn’t help. Hey Wendy’s: if you’re going to put an app out, please make sure it works. Otherwise it just wastes time and pisses your customers off.",1,'C'man,2020-09-10 17:15:05,False,,Wendys
184,No way to get a refund,"I ordered food through the app. I was parked at the location, walked up to go in to get my food and the dinning room doors were locked. The sign outside said it was open. The drive thru line was backed all the way around the building and out to the street. I walked up to the window and was told my order was not ready. From the placing the order till the time I left it was 40 mins! I did not receive my food and I asked for a refund. I was told I had to do it through the app. Well that’s funny there is no way to do it. I will no longer use this app. I have gotten no where with the restaurant or the district manager.",1,Noah Joseph,2020-09-06 16:34:35,False,,Wendys
185,Terrible app,"The first time I placed an order the app did not notify the store so when I got there I had to wait for the store to cook everything and it took 15 mins. The next time I used the app the breakfast menu was not available at my nearby store, the only stores I could order from were 30 miles plus. I called the store and there were currently serving breakfast. The last and final time I tried using the app when I tried placing an order for breakfast the app stated you just missed breakfast, all breakfast orders must be placed by 1025am how does lunch sound? The time was 930am. Too many problems with the app so I deleted this app!",1,Lamarr33,2020-04-28 17:21:31,False,,Wendys
186,Wendy’s restaurant,"With the stay at home order for now with the corona virus. My husband went and got us our dinner. I have never had a problem with this Wendy’s ever. But this time I got cold and old fries. I could not eat them. My husband ordered a baconator and bacon cheese burger. They were not right. And cold. They give us a bacon cheeseburger and a cheese burger. The baconator shows two cheeseburgers and bacon. So I was very disappointed in my dinner this time. I hope they get better. Should of had fresh fries. I didn’t get a receipt with my order. So I can’t give you the number of the store. It is the one in South Zanesville, in Ohio. Thank you I hope they get better.",1,debdover,2020-04-10 23:45:00,False,,Wendys
187,Needs work especially around payment,"No support for Apple Pay. The app is not even capable of scanning a credit card with the devices camera. These are features competitors apps have added months or in many cases years ago. Additionally, I also ordered once and when I showed up the restaurant was closed (middle of the day). How can the app even allow ordering from a restaurant that is not even own? The only good thing about the app is it is great at providing customization. It makes it clear what is included and what has been customized.",2,mcspaul,2021-11-13 00:43:16,False,,Wendys
188,Rewards don’t work,"I have show the barcode to the cashier 15+/- times and they scan it before I pay but I have only had reward points upload twice. 
Sometimes the cashiers look at me weird when I show it for them to scan but there is clearly signage that advertises this app posted.
My stores are not open for dining so I cannot use mobile order. 
It’s frustrating that the rewards don’t work and when I decided to cash in the little reward I earned it didn’t work again. So I cashed in my points and the app took my reward but the cashier said nothing came through. 
This app needs work.",1,karlee66,2021-11-06 10:52:04,False,,Wendys
189,Why would it still let me order,"Why would the app let me place a mobile order with a coupon in the cart if I didn’t add the item manually after having adding the coupon. I didn’t know I needed to do that, seems unnecessary, and it placed the order anyways. No warning that there’s a coupon without the item on the coupon. Thanks didn’t want my free fries anyways. And of course the worker couldn’t just give me the side of fries I would have had to make another purchase. First time in a long time ordering Wendy’s and probably the last. Oh and they don’t have Apple Pay, definitely the last.",1,heyhidan,2021-05-09 04:29:18,False,,Wendys
190,"Food and Deals - 5/5, App Functionality 1/5","Wendy’s is awesome and I love to order breakfast or order ahead on my lunch break. Rewards are excellent and easy to redeem. Delivery is a cheaper option than Grubhub/DoorDash pricing 

Problem is that it usually takes me forever to actually order via the app. It will often crash entirely so I have to delete and re-download the app, and maybe 1 of every three orders will run into an error screen before I can process payment. Errors are very generic, so I don’t know if the store is closed or delivery is not offered or if it’s an app or payment issue. 

Good food, good rewards, horrible app experience.",1,Corey L. ,2021-06-01 15:10:25,False,,Wendys
191,Deceptive,"I’ve used the app numerous times, but I’m about to give up and head to other restaurants. More than once I’ve thought I applied a deal, but got to the drive-thru and discovered it wasn’t applied. If I select a deal, I should be prompted to select the items for the deal *right there*. Also the app is not updated in a timely manner when deals expire. This morning I looked at the app and expected a “buy 1, get one for $1” but only found out at the drive-thru that the deal was over. 🙁 Really?",3,Dave D from WV,2020-06-30 17:21:19,False,,Wendys
192,Good app but...,"There are some flaws, such as missing menu items. For some reason, the ENTIRE breakfast category has disappeared as an option on my app, yet remains on my two roommates apps?? (It's currently 9:33am so I know breakfast is currently being served and this has been an ongoing issue). Another thing I've noticed is that drinks are missing. I love sweet tea, but the app only allows me to select the unsweetened version because there is no sweet option to select.",4,Sinder3llaAireal,2020-05-16 13:35:27,False,,Wendys
193,"Can’t customize, order ready too soon","We decided to order from Wendys today because my husband had an errand to run next door.  The app automatically told Wendys that my husband was there while he was running his errand.  This meant that he had to go into the store because they had already given up looking for his car by the time he actually arrived.  Also, the frostys had melted while sitting around.  And when he got home and we looked at the order, they had ignored all the customization I had asked for, including the salad dressing which is a required customization when ordering a salad.",1,Sky Elf,2021-05-04 20:00:25,False,,Wendys
194,Amazing deals but STILL gotta wait in that line,"I placed a mobile order so that it would be faster so that I could get to work on time because the customers are usually wrapped around the building twice. 

Well I get here and realized I still have to sit in the long ridiculous line because they don’t bring the food out to you. 

Now not only can’t I go somewhere else that’s faster before work, but ill be late for work because I had to purchase it with a credit card when placing it online and I’m not giving up my money for the food if I drive-off. 

This mobile ordering online is stupid if you have to still wait in the line.

UPDATE: I was extremely late for work and my food was cold because it had apparently been sitting on the counter the whole 45 minutes I waited in line. Never again. Never.",3,6787JennN,2020-11-08 17:55:30,False,,Wendys
195,Place an order only to not have one,"I used the app to place a huge order at work. Go to check out on a $100+ order and it had NOTHING in the cart and would not let me add anything. Spent a hour deleting app, reinstalling and placing orders again only for same thing to happen two more times.  Tried on another persons app and same thing. Went to Chic Fil A instead that day. Decided to give a shot again tonight and surprise surprise exact same thing ya happened. Won’t waste my time again. Hate giving a one star rating or bad review but how you gonna have a app for mobile orders when it Does not work?",1,Summlee27,2020-10-02 23:25:30,False,,Wendys
196,"Solid App, but additional features needed.","The app works great and it is very easy to order food. However, a few features would make this a 5 star app:

1. Apple Pay. There is no Apple Pay feature and you are only allowed to save one card at a time.

2. Coca-cola freestyle option for restaurants that have it. If you want a drink that is not listed on the app, you need to request it at the restaurant. A no ice option would be nice as well.",4,JProgrammer1,2020-11-11 17:51:59,False,,Wendys
197,Good food bad App,"Let’s start here, nobody in your stores knows how to use these apps. Manager even told me on more than one occasion they don’t really know a lot about the app. 

Not aloud to use earned rewards and the frosty key tag in the same order but yet I paid for both of those items but I can’t get them on the same order -which is likely the reason I lose points, it’s too complicated to use them. 

Tonight was a perfect example, tried to use 700 points for a salad and I’ve followed the complicated steps to get those points loaded to my card and yet it didn’t load and when they scanned my barcode I needed to pay for the salad and still lost my 700 points. 

I think your app causes you to lose money because managers are gracious enough to comp certain items. 

I could probably find a high school student to rewrite your app, let me know, I have connections…or ask Starbucks, they seem to have worked out the kinks.",1,Cassa.Pelosa,2021-09-13 03:39:27,False,,Wendys
198,"Garbage App, doesn’t work.","If you don’t continuously get an error message trying to get in, no matter what you change to correct the issue, you’ll constantly be trapped in loading screens and broken buttons that either do nothing or take so long to do something it times out the request.
Def needs a lot of repairs and updates. My big thoughts on wildly broken websites or apps is; If you can’t trust it to do it’s job properly you probably also can’t trust the security of it. 
I don’t recommend using the app until updates are implemented to the functionality as a /minimum/ standard.",1,Essakidwell4884,2021-08-18 22:38:29,False,,Wendys
199,"App not bad, employees need better training","Half the time, they say they don’t have the order, even though my credit card has already been charged.

Once, they claimed I had to have ordered it for a different Wendy’s location, even though the app showed their address. They denied it was their address, even after I showed them on Apple Maps that it was their address. Then another employee chimed in and said that they had already given my order to someone else, which is why they couldn’t find the mobile order.

I don’t expect fast food employees to be geniuses, but it seems if half the time they can’t successfully fulfill a simple order, I’m not going to take the risk anymore. I’d rather your employees just be someone else’s problem.

I’ve submitted feedback to Wendy’s through the app on several occasions, but they never respond. I don’t think they care.",2,BigDaddyG1234567,2021-02-25 15:37:49,False,,Wendys
