0,2020-04-18 15:23:05,False,"This app is better than most fast food apps when it comes to ease of use, customizing and managing orders.  If I had written this review a year ago, it would have gotten more stars; however, there are some growing issues related to limitations on orders that need to be fixed.

The deals being offered are becoming more complicated and causing more and more problems.  For example, I created an order that declined to process because a deal I was able to apply to my order was no longer being honored at a particular location at a particular time.  This caused me to start over completely, picking another deal that is appropriate to a different order combination.  Then, my new order wouldn‚Äôt process because the unhonored deal from my first order stopped me from picking a new deal for 24 hours.  It would be my recommendation to reprogram the app to not record the use of a deal until a purchase has been completed and change the 24 hour policy to 20 hours so that customers that pick up a daily breakfast at a slightly earlier time than the previous day can use another deal.

Reoccurring glitches in payment processing has also been on a rise of late.  Several customers pay with the app and are asked to pay again when going to the drive-up window.  My online banking shows I am billed twice and at the end of the day, one of the two transactions are being credited back.",FamilyMoji Idea,"{'id': 14762247, 'body': ""We're sorry about your experience with Mobile Order & Pay!

1,2021-12-10 20:01:08,False,"I‚Äôm a mega coupon fanatic. Every time I go out I‚Äôm always paying for more than one. So coupons have saved my wallet a substantial amount. This app started with a bang. The coupons constantly changed and were always very valuable deals. But with the years passing, I‚Äôve only saw the deals get more and more limited and you‚Äôll only save 50 cent on a 10 dollar order. And when I say limited, I mean it. I‚Äôve had the same coupons for over a year. With very minor changes. But those changes happen every 2-4 months and are gone within a week. The only deal that makes the app worth having anymore is the bogo for 25 cent on the quarter pounders. This one still saves the hole in my pocket. But then I‚Äôm limited to eating a quarter pounder anytime I‚Äôm at McDonald‚Äôs. Which I wouldn‚Äôt complain about normally but after a year, it‚Äôll burnout, trust me.  It‚Äôs just very disappointing  to see something that was so good turn into something so bad. I very much hope the developers will look into the main aspect of the app a bit more. Till then, if anyone feels the way I do, you can check out the Wendys app. They have incredible deals that change almost weekly.

3,2021-08-11 15:33:01,False,"I recently had to place an order three times because the app timed out when my screen went to sleep. Thankfully it only charged me once. 
I placed the initial order on our way to the restaurant. My screen turned off on the way there after placing the order. When we arrived at the restaurant there was no record of my order in the app. My debit card was recently destroyed so Apple Pay was the only option until my new card came in. So I tried to place the order at the restaurant, but the entire app had timed out meaning I had to log in again. For some reason it wouldn‚Äôt log me in. I kept getting error messages. We were in a hurry so I had to leave the restaurant. The app started working again when we got home and since my husband had promised our toddler nuggets, I went back out to get the meal (I really didn‚Äôt mind). Since I was having issues ordering at the restaurant, I placed the order at home and then drove over. Again, the order was not on record. Thankfully the entire app didn‚Äôt time out and I was able to place the order at the restaurant. Took them 25 minutes to get my food out to the car.
I doubt I will use the app again. It was such a hassle and took so much longer than the drive through or even ordering through door dash. Other stores, like chick fil a, have figured out how to let people place an order before getting to the restaurant.

I just wish this app were designed a little better and the stores were a little better trained for mobile orders. One big problem I have is the unnecessary requirement to share your location. This just feels like a huge violation of privacy and for no gain. They want you to share your location and it actively uses it anytime you even open the app. I can kind of understand it so they can estimate when they need to prepare your order and I believe that is their reason, but; 1) if it already tracks your location why should you have to click in the app that you arrived at the restaurant? 2) since it is a fast food restaurant, most of the time your order should already be ready. I guess the app just guarantees it? The app actively tracks your location, and not request a location like it should if it wants that. The deals are kind of annoying because they cannot be combined and can only be used once per hour. Overall, the app just feels like a way for McDonald‚Äôs to steal your information and takes a lot of work to save $1.

7,2021-03-07 17:53:47,False,"The McDonald‚Äôs app has been great generally over the years. But when they change it you lose earned rewards. I‚Äôve done so many times, the worst recentlyWhen they changed from my caf√© rewards to the regular McDonald‚Äôs rewards. In the past for every five coffee drinks you bought you would get one free. I had bought coffee almost daily on my way to work and hardly ever redeemed them. At one time I had over 28 or 29 mccaf√© coffee‚Äôs to redeem. Even though the expiration date had passed one day I noticed seven or eight of them had disappeared. So I started using them. I built them up again and again and use them here and there. Maybe a month ago I had 22 Mccaf√© drinks and they change the app again to rewards instead of the caf√© drinks. I checked the app and I were seven showing four or five of which had to be redeemed within a few days or they would disappear/expire. I didn‚Äôt have time to use the mall and ended up losing four or five of those. If you figure those drinks run an average of 4 to 5 dollars each and lost a couple hundred dollars and drinks over the years. And I bought a couple hundred coffees  a year from McDonald‚Äôs.

8,2021-11-19 19:57:33,True,"It‚Äôs mind-boggling how an app is promoted for a fast food joint but yet not have everything on the App Menu as the ‚Äúrestaurant‚Äù would. I searched through the app, through the ‚Äúdeals‚Äù and it was simply not there. I go to the ‚Äúrestaurant‚Äù and it‚Äôs available as an option. The two need to be synced for optimal experience for the user. Update (1) - now when you Checkout and state you are at the location for pickup, it wouldn‚Äôt allow for me to select an option of how I want to pick up (curbside, drive-thru, etc.).

Update (2) - now it seems the Meals are ‚Äúsynced‚Äù along with the option of how to pick up BUT one outstanding issue still remains - When the location is to make the food. It won‚Äôt allow you to do it while on route or close by. Nope. You have to select it while you are in the parking lot of the location. Why is that bad? Because when you select to pick up in store, the food is still not ready. At times, the folks on the line get their food first still. Pickup for Drive-thru‚Ä¶well you would have to wait if there is a long line (still!). ‚ÄúCurbside‚Äù - similar issue as pick-up in-store option. Food is not yet ready.

The sheer scale of McDonald‚Äôs locations almost makes a single app a foolhardy idea, but this one works a lot of the time. When it does, it‚Äôs fantastic - I like being able to see what‚Äôs on a sandwich and specify no (or extra) of a topping, and the Deals are often really good. I also love being able to park in a curbside spot and wait with my radio and AC, rather than wait in the store or at the drive thru lane.

The problem is the menu in the app, which appears to cover all markets and includes items my local stores don't offer. Sometimes it stops you before you place the order, and other times the order just errors out with no explanation. So be wary of ordering any items you wouldn't see on the store's displayed menu, like Sweet Chili or Szechuan dipping sauces, or the Oreo Frappe, which is in there even though my local stores act like it doesn't exist.

As of recently, about 2 months, those deals are no longer there so I really no longer have anything to gain which is quite disappointing because I do love the app and have been such a fan. I just purchased some items that would have been $4 less had I still had my regular deals. If these new changes to the app will be permanent I only wish McDonald‚Äôs would consider deals that are frequented by consumers so that they can be tailored and continue to be taken advantage of. Also consider dietary needs and restrictions I used to have 10-20 deal to select from now I have 3-7 that I know I will not use. For example, I have a free any size soft beverage deal in my app right now, I can‚Äôt drink soda so I have no use for such a coupon.

I assume what happened is that perhaps there is a more limited breakfast menu from 10:30-11:00 even though 1) it said breakfast until 11, and 2) the app was giving me the same full breakfast menu even at 10:35.

19,2019-09-07 17:05:13,False,Over engineered and poorly executed.  Downloaded the app and placed my first order.  We were good up to this point.  After placing the order and paying with Apple Pay the app went to a page that told me I had to  tell the app when I was close so that the order would be prepared.  No option to simply say be ready in 30 minutes.  My plan was to place the order and have someone else pick it up.  Not happening if I have to tell it I am close using my phone.  Drive to McDonald‚Äôs where the app tracked my location.  It did not automatically submit the order for preparation when I was near so I am not sure why they needed to track my location.  When I arrived I pressed the I am already here link in the app.  It then popped over to a screen telling me I had to select my pickup option.  Unfortunately the screen which I assume was supposed to have options was blank.  The  employees at McDonald‚Äôs had no idea what to do and didn‚Äôt really care either way.  Restarted the app several time but always ended up on the same blank pickup options screen.  I was able to cancel the order and reorder from the kiosk inside the store until that failed when I tried to pay at the kiosk.  Took me twice as long to get lunch as it would have to just walk in and place my order at the counter.  The reason I rated this app so poorly is not only that it failed to perform but that McDonald‚Äôs is capable of so much better than this.,Ntfreak,,1,Worst app ever,McDonalds
20,2022-01-26 16:18:01,False,"This is clearly the best app I‚Äôve used for any fast food restaurant. It works. And I don‚Äôt mean just the app on your device, but the back office operations that are required to fulfill your order.  
The worst bug I experience is after one picks up their food. A day or two may go by, and then when I open to use the app again it hasn‚Äôt cleared out my past fulfilled order, and it automatically reloads the past order into the cart.  Then I have to go manually delete every item that I ordered before, so I can make a new order. Not a giant problem, more like just annoying. 
Not a formal bug, but a design error IMO, As I wish they made it easier to add condiments to an order. I think it should be the last thing selected before a person confirms their order. It‚Äôs easy to forget to add the condiments, then when I pick up my food I ask the personnel on duty for it, and although I get it, I can tell it‚Äôs a tiny annoyance for them - a break in their flow.

This is the worst customer service ever. You guys should be ashamed of yourself. If I could have gotten my money back from the app I would have left and went somewhere else.

***In response to the developer‚Äôs response to my grievances with this app, I‚Äôd say that I still stand firm that the app needs work. It‚Äôs literally the slowest way to order at McDonald‚Äôs. There are MANY ways this could be rectified.  For instance provide a tracker similar to Domino‚Äôs. You could also provide a tone block for the customer to pick up the food.

It‚Äôs a horrible experience that simply discourages me from going to McDonald‚Äôs.

So I thought ordering through this new app would solve that whole debacle and make for a faster, more pleasant experience. Unfortunately, I have yet to be able to successfully order anything. I added one of the daily deals and then tried to order an additional burger along with it, but could only select from breakfast items (it was definitely past breakfast time), so I gave up for that day. A few days later, I tried ordering again, but when I tried to add a new deal, the app says I can only add one deal per order. Sure enough, the deal I had added before is still in my bag, but expired and I couldn‚Äôt for the life of me figure out how to delete it (I‚Äôve since figured it out, but well after the fact).

I've found countless stores that get everything right all the time but never one like mine. How is it possible to screw up one customers order ten times in a row? Statistically with all the other customers it is impossible. Just like it should be impossible for the app to fail loading every time I try to use the deals section at prime hours but it does. And only then. Works just fine at two in the morning or ten at night. Go figure. But like I said you don't really want to hear all that from me. You need to wipe that location off the map and start with a new store.  Building and all cause it must be cursed. And I've written to HQ and to the actually owner plus the manager for luck. Never heard back which really disappointed me. So now instead of going there several times a week I go to Wendy's or Burger King. And on special occasions I will go to McDonald's but after the attitude the woman gave me at Moorestown I'll probably stop doing that. I broke a cardinal rule. I asked for tenders after nine at night. I once asked at eleven and thought the guy was going to hit me. You'd think if something is that popular you'd order enough to cover the entire day.

I understand something could come up and prevent you from arriving to receive your order... but with the Starbucks App your order gets started right away (now that app has its own problems, half the time it can‚Äôt find the store I‚Äôm 2 blocks away from, but that‚Äôs another review). Because of this I find myself getting breakfast sandwiches at Starbucks more often even though I would prefer the fresh cracked eggs at McDonald‚Äôs. Maybe put a disclaimer box that people can confirm/check when they order that stipulates that if they are unable to pick up their order within 20 min it will be discarded with no refund offered.  If you enter a busy McDonald‚Äôs nowadays it takes a whiiiile to get your food. Usually I‚Äôll confirm that I‚Äôm at the restaurant on my app but then sit in my car for 10 min before going in -and sometimes end up waiting another 10 min anyway! Just can‚Äôt win.

Problem #3 I noticed that it says they were preparing the order which confused me since it specifically doesn‚Äôt let the order through unless you were at the location. This threw me because previously I have been closer and it still wouldn‚Äôt let me place the order until I was right outside the store.

I did so due to convenience and my perceived safety with drive through only during the COVID pandemic. I just placed an order on the app with my total $5.90 w/tax.  Immediately afterward, I happened to pop on to my Discover account to check on to my next payment due date.  I saw a pending charge of $8.01 so I checked the recent order still showing on my McD‚Äôs app and sure enough, it still showed $5.90.  Moments later my email had a receipt for $8.01. A promo selected in my app now was removed.  

I have been frustrated on a business expense level that one cannot go back into the app to see past purchases. Receipts via email are hit and miss. Now to see McDonalds processes higher payments than showing through the app is the final straw. I have no way to know how often this overcharging occurs.  

 My wife and I have often discussed why do we go to McD‚Äôs?  The food generally is inferior to Wendy‚Äôs, Burger King, Hardee‚Äôs/ Carl Junior.

Usually an okay app. However, you may want to fix the recent bug that has prevented ordering through the app. The cart doesnt allow resetting the cart. So all you can do is remove individual items. However recently it has locked expired coupons. So I‚Äôm unable to order anything because a coupon from several weeks ago is locked in my cart. I‚Äôve tried logging out and reinstalling the app, but neither does anything. I‚Äôm not sure why a store with a location- and time-specific menu would make it so difficult to clear the cart - but you may want to fix this.  And, it would make more sense if the cart also cleared after an order was completed. For some reason all of the items just stay in the cart, as if someone wants to keep reordering the same items by default.

It charged my card for those items. I called customer service for help and she had no idea how to help me but said charge would probably fall off in 48 hours. Nope, it still charged my card.

I visit McDonald‚Äôs on the daily and sometimes multiple times a day.  This is beyond disappointing and frustrating.  Another issue I encountered is that the app no longer gives you the option to add the item or the meal.  It simply adds the item for you and then you have to add the fries and drink separately.

-After paying for and getting your food, the app continues to monitor your location. You‚Äôll drive an hour away, look at your phone, and for some unknown reason the app is still using your location. You have to force quit to make it stop.
-When you next use the app, even if weeks later, it retains your last order as if it was never completed.

-The app doesn‚Äôt always register when you‚Äôre at the location, even after clicking that you‚Äôre there. This may partially be due to employee training, but after years you‚Äôd really think that this was something that McDonald‚Äôs could get down
-It always assumes you want the closest McDonald‚Äôs, which may work the majority of the time... but if you‚Äôre traveling in a different direction (e.g., to work in the morning on the same route you take everyday) you have to manually change location every single time.

165,2020-07-04 13:16:16,False,"With the recent Covid situation, I‚Äôve found myself to be using restaurant apps more frequently to order and pay remotely so as to reduce person-to-person contact.

So I‚Äôve been using several apps, and McDonald‚Äôs app usually runs pretty well. I have run into a couple of situations that the restaurant was not able to help me with.

First instance was when the restaurant was out of Coke. They asked if they could give me something else to drink, however there‚Äôs not really anything else I wanted so I requested if they could remove it from my bill. They were unable to do so so they gave me my food and I figured I would just have to pay for a Coke I didn‚Äôt get.

Second instance I believe is related to the first one. I ordered through the app and it showed I paid, however it did not show as paid in the system at the restaurant. So I gave them my card and paid in person. At that point I had not received an email receipt for the first instance, so I wonder if because that first hadn‚Äôt cleared the second wouldn‚Äôt.

Those normally wouldn‚Äôt be a problem, however around a month after those occurred, I got email receipts for both, the first having the Coke I didn‚Äôt get and the second being a double charge for what I paid for in person.

So as the title says, this is a good app, however it might require some in store training (which I understand McDonald‚Äôs employs a lot of people so that may not be realistic).",Talon Darkfire,"{'id': 16440788, 'body': 'Hi there!

This means you can‚Äôt do it easily at a red light... you have to do it in advance which then leads to the restaurant switch. It also automatically puts you‚Äôre last order in your cart. Who orders the exact same thing every time???  I deleted this app. I would get it again only if three things were done: 1) allow searches for items based on keywords like ‚Äúmocha‚Äù; 2) allow users to permanently choose a location unless they want to search the closest; and 3) allow previous orders to go into a favorites where they can be easily pulled again but do not stay in the cart.

And McDonald‚Äôs is ignoring me on Twitter. This app charged me several times for an order I made, but never completed the order. By the way, you can‚Äôt cancel or modify an order once you‚Äôve started it, possibly due to bugs(?) so I couldn‚Äôt use the app anymore because it kept adding new items to the same original order, without allowing me to remove any items. I deleted the app and reinstalled, and now my order history is gone. I ordered the sandwich at the register instead and was late gettin back to work because of how long it took. I paid $6 for a $2 sandwich. When I tried to submit feedback through the app, I found the feedback form to be broken. I messaged the company both privately and publicly on twitter, no response.

Edit: after the transaction was refunded I decided to get the app another chance. This time at the restaurant on old Saint Augustine Road in Jacksonville Florida. I submitted a very simple order: a quarter pounder with cheese standard. I submitted the order on the way to the restaurant, when I arrived on that block the app recognized I was there, I pulled into the drive through and told them at the speaker which order I was, they said to go ahead and pull around. At the first window it took them getting a manager to get a receipt from the system. At the second window I was told they still had not made my order that I submitted in adv and instructed me to wait in one of the parking spots. For a simple quarter pounder with cheese.

The first time I had to give my order again in the drive through. On the second occurrence, I made a mental note of the order number before I left home. When I arrived and the button disappeared that time I was able to have the manager of the store look up my order in their system without having to place the order again.

I explained that the mobile app was not actually working and showed it to the cashier who looked at me like I was crazy before. They said they could not ring up anything larger than 10 nuggets and I wanted to order the 40 nuggets and was gonna cost me about 4x the cost of the mobile order.

Okay so at least I don‚Äôt have to wait in line.  But you are... added to the backlog they have at that time.  So you sit and wait.

So when they started processing my order after I checked in they took that adorable customized order slip and put in on the next standard issue sandwich‚Äôs that came up.  Not only did I get the stuff that I didn‚Äôt want on the sandwich but I didn‚Äôt get the stuff I paid extra to add.  None of this do I learn until I get back to the office.

When I went through the drive thru, I was suddenly charged a different amount than I was originally given with no way to dispute it because my card was already charged. I was suddenly charged for the hash brown that was supposed to be free.
