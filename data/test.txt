"This app is better than most fast food apps when it comes to ease of use, customizing and managing orders.  If I had written this review a year ago, it would have gotten more stars; however, there are some growing issues related to limitations on orders that need to be fixed.

The deals being offered are becoming more complicated and causing more and more problems.  For example, I created an order that declined to process because a deal I was able to apply to my order was no longer being honored at a particular location at a particular time.  This caused me to start over completely, picking another deal that is appropriate to a different order combination.  Then, my new order wouldn‚Äôt process because the unhonored deal from my first order stopped me from picking a new deal for 24 hours.  It would be my recommendation to reprogram the app to not record the use of a deal until a purchase has been completed and change the 24 hour policy to 20 hours so that customers that pick up a daily breakfast at a slightly earlier time than the previous day can use another deal.

Reoccurring glitches in payment processing has also been on a rise of late.  Several customers pay with the app and are asked to pay again when going to the drive-up window.  My online banking shows I am billed twice and at the end of the day, one of the two transactions are being credited back."
"I‚Äôm a mega coupon fanatic. Every time I go out I‚Äôm always paying for more than one. So coupons have saved my wallet a substantial amount. This app started with a bang. The coupons constantly changed and were always very valuable deals. But with the years passing, I‚Äôve only saw the deals get more and more limited and you‚Äôll only save 50 cent on a 10 dollar order. And when I say limited, I mean it. I‚Äôve had the same coupons for over a year. With very minor changes. But those changes happen every 2-4 months and are gone within a week. The only deal that makes the app worth having anymore is the bogo for 25 cent on the quarter pounders. This one still saves the hole in my pocket. But then I‚Äôm limited to eating a quarter pounder anytime I‚Äôm at McDonald‚Äôs. Which I wouldn‚Äôt complain about normally but after a year, it‚Äôll burnout, trust me.  It‚Äôs just very disappointing  to see something that was so good turn into something so bad. I very much hope the developers will look into the main aspect of the app a bit more. Till then, if anyone feels the way I do, you can check out the Wendys app. They have incredible deals that change almost weekly. I‚Äôm actually on my way to get a burger,fry,drink,chicken nuggets and chili cheese fries. All for the price of one McDonald‚Äôs quarter pounder. I hope I can say something similar about the McDonald‚Äôs app in the near future."
"I work at a large hospital and walk by McDonalds which is by the entrance to the hospital on my way in.  While in the parking garage I will place an order for two hot mocha McCafes for pick up on my app. I then walk to an area where I get a face mask and have my temperature taken then eneter the building.  This is around 8:00 am.  If I‚Äôm lucky someone will be behind the counter to help me.  My order is never ready and I always have to wait for my coffees to be made.  Meanwhile people are coming in behind me placing orders, getting their food and drinks and leaving.  There are also times when I walk into the restaurant and not only is no one behind the counter, no one is anywhere to be found, not even in the food prep area.  I have to call out or shout so someone will come out from a closed door to wait on me.  Then again I have to wait for my coffees to be made.  I got the McDonald's app hoping my order while placed in advance would be ready for me upon arrival.  Not once has it been.  I skip paying since the app has no problem taking my payment.  I wish your service was that efficient!  But it isn‚Äôt!  I have found my experiences dissapointing and frustrating!  A waste of time which has caused me on several occasions to be late for work!"
"I recently had to place an order three times because the app timed out when my screen went to sleep. Thankfully it only charged me once. 
I placed the initial order on our way to the restaurant. My screen turned off on the way there after placing the order. When we arrived at the restaurant there was no record of my order in the app. My debit card was recently destroyed so Apple Pay was the only option until my new card came in. So I tried to place the order at the restaurant, but the entire app had timed out meaning I had to log in again. For some reason it wouldn‚Äôt log me in. I kept getting error messages. We were in a hurry so I had to leave the restaurant. The app started working again when we got home and since my husband had promised our toddler nuggets, I went back out to get the meal (I really didn‚Äôt mind). Since I was having issues ordering at the restaurant, I placed the order at home and then drove over. Again, the order was not on record. Thankfully the entire app didn‚Äôt time out and I was able to place the order at the restaurant. Took them 25 minutes to get my food out to the car.
I doubt I will use the app again. It was such a hassle and took so much longer than the drive through or even ordering through door dash. Other stores, like chick fil a, have figured out how to let people place an order before getting to the restaurant. It doesn‚Äôt seem like it‚Äôd be a difficult thing to do."
"I don‚Äôt even know what more to do about this app... I guess I just won‚Äôt ever get to use the daily deals or use a mobile order since it has NEVER worked on my phone. I have an IPhone 12 Pro that has the newest software update and have tried over and over again to delete the app and re download without any success. Even before I got the 12 Pro I had the X and for over a year now I‚Äôve always gotten a message when I tried logging in that said ‚ÄúCritical Error has Occurred, App needs to restart.‚Äù I tried logging into an existing account that I had created a few years back and got this message every single time so I tried signing up for a new account and still received this message. I contacted McDonald‚Äôs via phone and someone in their IT department said they would ‚Äúpass along the information to their developers and hopefully with the next update it would be fixed.‚Äù Today I tried to re download the app again since it‚Äôs $1 fries for mobile users and I thought just maybe today it will work for me... nope! So now when I download the app it just completely crashed and doesn‚Äôt even load. I have missed out on so many deals and feel beyond frustrated that I can‚Äôt even do a mobile order for pickup. I researched online and other people have had this same issue without getting it resolved. You would think that with McDonald‚Äôs being one of the largest corporations in the world that they would have figured out all these bugs and issues by now. So disappointed üò°"
"For starters, I‚Äôm generally against fast food apps because it‚Äôs typically faster to just order it in the drive through but I thought I would give the McDonald‚Äôs app a shot since they have some pretty good deals. I just wish this app were designed a little better and the stores were a little better trained for mobile orders. One big problem I have is the unnecessary requirement to share your location. This just feels like a huge violation of privacy and for no gain. They want you to share your location and it actively uses it anytime you even open the app. I can kind of understand it so they can estimate when they need to prepare your order and I believe that is their reason, but; 1) if it already tracks your location why should you have to click in the app that you arrived at the restaurant? 2) since it is a fast food restaurant, most of the time your order should already be ready. I guess the app just guarantees it? The app actively tracks your location, and not request a location like it should if it wants that. The deals are kind of annoying because they cannot be combined and can only be used once per hour. Overall, the app just feels like a way for McDonald‚Äôs to steal your information and takes a lot of work to save $1. The app doesn‚Äôt even improve the ordering process because some stores will have problems finding your order"
"I‚Äôve been using this app for a couple months now, and it has become increasingly frustrating. Yeah, you gain points quick and there are good deals on there, so overall I would say it‚Äôs worth having, but the glitches are too much. For starters, every single time I open my app (unless it‚Äôs multiple times in one day) it says I‚Äôve been logged out due to an error, and have to log back in again. It is just a few clicks, but it‚Äôs beyond annoying, especially when you‚Äôre trying to get food from a fast food restaurant, well, fast. Secondly, there have been countless times I‚Äôve had to completely redo an order because a promo/deal was not longer available at my location‚Ä¶even though it takes me literal minutes to order because most of my stuff is saved. If it was no longer available, why show it as an option? Finally, the stress with workers not wanting to honor deals when I don‚Äôt do mobile ordering is terrible. 90% of the time they scan a reward they say it‚Äôs not valid, just to have a manager have to come and tell them how to enter it manually because it‚Äôs an app issue not a promo issue. I‚Äôve come to use it less and less because saving a couple bucks really isn‚Äôt always worth the frustration and work I have to put into something that supposed to streamline and make a process more efficient."
"The McDonald‚Äôs app has been great generally over the years. But when they change it you lose earned rewards. I‚Äôve done so many times, the worst recentlyWhen they changed from my caf√© rewards to the regular McDonald‚Äôs rewards. In the past for every five coffee drinks you bought you would get one free. I had bought coffee almost daily on my way to work and hardly ever redeemed them. At one time I had over 28 or 29 mccaf√© coffee‚Äôs to redeem. Even though the expiration date had passed one day I noticed seven or eight of them had disappeared. So I started using them. I built them up again and again and use them here and there. Maybe a month ago I had 22 Mccaf√© drinks and they change the app again to rewards instead of the caf√© drinks. I checked the app and I were seven showing four or five of which had to be redeemed within a few days or they would disappear/expire. I didn‚Äôt have time to use the mall and ended up losing four or five of those. If you figure those drinks run an average of 4 to 5 dollars each and lost a couple hundred dollars and drinks over the years. And I bought a couple hundred coffees  a year from McDonald‚Äôs. For many years... this has made me much less trusting of the McDonald‚Äôs app."
"It‚Äôs mind-boggling how an app is promoted for a fast food joint but yet not have everything on the App Menu as the ‚Äúrestaurant‚Äù would. I searched through the app, through the ‚Äúdeals‚Äù and it was simply not there. I go to the ‚Äúrestaurant‚Äù and it‚Äôs available as an option. The two need to be synced for optimal experience for the user. Update (1) - now when you Checkout and state you are at the location for pickup, it wouldn‚Äôt allow for me to select an option of how I want to pick up (curbside, drive-thru, etc.). Small item as such needs to be fixed.
Update (2) - now it seems the Meals are ‚Äúsynced‚Äù along with the option of how to pick up BUT one outstanding issue still remains - When the location is to make the food. It won‚Äôt allow you to do it while on route or close by. Nope. You have to select it while you are in the parking lot of the location. Why is that bad? Because when you select to pick up in store, the food is still not ready. At times, the folks on the line get their food first still. Pickup for Drive-thru‚Ä¶well you would have to wait if there is a long line (still!). ‚ÄúCurbside‚Äù - similar issue as pick-up in-store option. Food is not yet ready.

Another main competitor allows for the food to be made ahead of time - when the user selects it. Make that happen and you may just get a 5-star rating. Until then. There are still better apps out there."
"Regular updates actually do make improvements to ordering (really glad to see drinks ordered by type in the latest update instead of a ten page long menu of every drink in every size), and the CS team was responsive the one time I contacted them.

The sheer scale of McDonald‚Äôs locations almost makes a single app a foolhardy idea, but this one works a lot of the time. When it does, it‚Äôs fantastic - I like being able to see what‚Äôs on a sandwich and specify no (or extra) of a topping, and the Deals are often really good. I also love being able to park in a curbside spot and wait with my radio and AC, rather than wait in the store or at the drive thru lane.

The problem is the menu in the app, which appears to cover all markets and includes items my local stores don't offer. Sometimes it stops you before you place the order, and other times the order just errors out with no explanation. So be wary of ordering any items you wouldn't see on the store's displayed menu, like Sweet Chili or Szechuan dipping sauces, or the Oreo Frappe, which is in there even though my local stores act like it doesn't exist. (And come on, just make me a Mocha Frappe and sprinkle some Oreo crumbs from the Flurry station in it. It's not like the ice cream machine is working today anyway.)"
"This started out as a great app, but now,  no longer deserves 4-5 stars. They‚Äôve done way too much to make it all fancy, that it makes the app work so slowly, when navigating between the different functions, especially when it first starts up. Also, annoying that certain deals are scan only, mobile only, deliver only...a deal is a deal. Why should it matter if we use it on the app, at the restaurant, or delivery? And stop the restrictions on using one deal for a certain amount of time!!! If I wanna use a deal, and get back to the end of the line to use another deal, I should be able to do so like the app allowed you to do originally! The new updates have not made anything better, but instead made it more buggy. I‚Äôve never had to keep logging back into my account before, but now it seems like the app can‚Äôt remember my login, even if I had already logged in 10 minutes prior, which is very annoying when you‚Äôre already in line and waiting for the now slow app to load up and then show the deals, with people waiting behind you. There should be a face/finger ID or stay logged in option. And I agree with another user, if I make an order from my phone and want a friend/family member pick it up, there should be a way to do that. If a super basic Little Caesar‚Äôs App can do that, then why can‚Äôt this one?!!!"
"Overall I enjoyed the app where I could customized my order specifically how I wanted it and could clearly see the price increase for each option - who wouldn‚Äôt more pickles for free or a extra slice of cheese for 30 cents.  Also there are daily app exclusive deals and coupons like buy one get one that are great and makes ordering tempting.  However; the issue and an app killer for me is the payment system.   Last 3 trips I ordered and set up for curbside delivery.  A few minutes latter the app shows there‚Äôs been an error and I need to ‚Äúgo inside to see the cashier‚Äù, so in these social distancing days that means going through the drive through.  When you pull up they can see your order but they say the Payment is still pending.  Each time I check the app and it gives me no option to retry payment or other options.  So i tell them at the window to cancel the order and end up leaving with no food.   I have now discovered that the charge later went through and still showed up on my credit card statement.  So now I have wasted time on trips to the restaurant, no food, and yet still get charged.  Now I have to spend more time on phone with credit card disputing the charges.  I will no longer use this faulty app.  My advise is to save your time and money and shop elsewhere, unless you wanna go through the drive through and pay double the app price."
"I have had the McDonald‚Äôs app since the beginning and always been an advocate and even encouraged my friends to get it. The thing is I don‚Äôt eat anything at McDonald‚Äôs besides fries and salads items, occasionally I may get a dessert or chicken item. In the beginning I was really able to take advantage of the $1 fry deals and the $3 off $10 or $1 off $7. As of recently, about 2 months, those deals are no longer there so I really no longer have anything to gain which is quite disappointing because I do love the app and have been such a fan. I just purchased some items that would have been $4 less had I still had my regular deals. If these new changes to the app will be permanent I only wish McDonald‚Äôs would consider deals that are frequented by consumers so that they can be tailored and continue to be taken advantage of. Also consider dietary needs and restrictions I used to have 10-20 deal to select from now I have 3-7 that I know I will not use. For example, I have a free any size soft beverage deal in my app right now, I can‚Äôt drink soda so I have no use for such a coupon. I have a $1 off a quarter pounder or Big Mac, also something I can‚Äôt have so it will go to waste. Then I have 2 others for a total of 4 deals that I cannot even take advantage of. Disappointing, especially because I know how great it used to be."
"I wasted time setting up an accout. I wasted time trying to set up an order. It goes as far as letting you fill out all your info, but won‚Äôt let you enter a card to pay for it. I tried 2 different cards, but the ‚Äòsave‚Äô button stays grayed out. I tried placing an order which it allowed me to do. But again, I couldn‚Äôt pay, as it wouldn‚Äôt allow me to save the card info. I hit ‚Äòplace order‚Äô figuring I‚Äôd just pay cash when I got there. The app said the order was placed. Gave me an order # and all, so I figured everything was good to go. It (the app) said they would start the order when I got there and hit ‚ÄòCheck In‚Äô. The only thing that came close to ‚Äòcheck In‚Äô was a button that said ‚ÄòI‚Äôm Already Here‚Äô. I pulled in to the parking lot and hit that button cuz nothing changed and it was the only option. Well... Of course the app is now saying It doesn‚Äôt have my order or maybe I‚Äôm not close enough OR talk to a crew member. I ended up having to go inside and place a whole new order which I was trying to avoid! Then it STILL took forever for these people to understand what I‚Äôm trying to explain what happened! It was so aggravating, the whole thing! Then I have to put up with their condescending attitudes... Unbelievable...
And of course there‚Äôs no one around to help figure out the problem. So that‚Äôs the last time I‚Äôll be going to McDonald‚Äôs any more. Who needs the aggravation?"
"This review is long overdue and after not being able to use the only good coupon I have got on this app in months because my McDonald‚Äôs that I always go to is no longer a ‚Äúparticipating location,‚Äù I finally feel the need to write this review. This app used to be SPECTACULAR and there were always plenty of coupons I could use daily and they were very good deals too! I was able to purchase food for myself and my family without breaking the bank too much. Then randomly one day they changed the entire app and removed all of the good coupons. Now there is one coupon daily (If I‚Äôm lucky two) and it can hardly be considered a ‚Äúdeal‚Äù as I‚Äôm saving like 30¬¢ rather than the $3-4 I used to save from a coupon. You can also get a coupon from this Plinko style game that you sometimes have to play a few times to even land something in the bag. From my experience you can play until you win however the $1 off coupon you receive after is normally never for anything I want so it‚Äôs hardly worth it. Not to mention it seems you have to use this coupon while ordering through the app and sitting in the parking lot, which is not my preferred way to eat at McDonald‚Äôs. They should bring this app back to its former glory so that it may have a purpose again because it‚Äôs current state is trash and I don‚Äôt even feel the need to open it as I wait in line at McDonald‚Äôs since I already know there will be no coupons worthwhile."
"At about 10:15am I was thinking to go to McDonald's for breakfast.  There is always the question of when breakfast is no longer served - app said 11am for my McDonald's.  Great!  I have more than enough time.  So I get there at about 10:25 and try to place my order via the app.  I get an error that certain items are no longer available and those are removed.  Darn, I'll need to select something else.  I go back to the menu and it's the same menu with all the items available.  Try to order again, unavailable.  I kill the app and reopen it to try to ""refresh"" the available items.  Same menu, and trying to order many of these items still gave me the same ""unavailable"" message.  At this point I am very frustrated and go to the nearby Starbucks instead.

I assume what happened is that perhaps there is a more limited breakfast menu from 10:30-11:00 even though 1) it said breakfast until 11, and 2) the app was giving me the same full breakfast menu even at 10:35.  What's frustrating is that the app has the ability to understand the item availability since it errored during checkout, but apparently this information is not incorporated when ""building"" the menu that is shown.  So it's basically trial-and-error to find something available.  Perhaps the app should lock down from 10-11am daily if it's not possible to serve an accurate menu during that time."
"Soooo...it sometimes works like it should, but it‚Äôs still buggy. And...I‚Äôve experienced that the employees at various locations aren‚Äôt well trained with mobile ordering. On more than one occasion I‚Äôve tried to pick up my order in the drive-thru, but the employee couldn‚Äôt close it out on their end. My card ends up getting charged several times, and I don‚Äôt get my food if I don‚Äôt have a way to pay for it on me. Therefore, I usually opt for curbside, which I don‚Äôt like doing either. I hate having the employees have to bring my food out to the mobile pickup if the weather is bad. Plus, if the order is wrong, then they have to go inside and come back out. 

One feature that is problematic with mobile ordering is that whatever phone you place the order from has to be the one arriving at the location because the app is tracking the phone. Almost all other mobile ordering apps don‚Äôt do that. For instance, if another family member is out and about and I‚Äôm sitting at home, I can‚Äôt order from the app and they pick it up. It tells me I‚Äôm not at the location. That‚Äôs annoying.

Lastly, the coupon deals are clunky. The coupon codes differ for each location. Therefore, you have to make sure you have the right location selected to get the correct coupon. It‚Äôs cumbersome the way that works."
"So the last couple times I‚Äôve ordered, it makes it seemed glitchy not start with while ordering. Tonight I went through making sure I had my $30 order for my family with everything they wanted right before checking out, read it aloud, showed my hubby and all. Think nothing of it bc it said they had my order and we waited. Get my order and it‚Äôs barely anything.. so look at my order and what‚Äôs in the bag is right, but that order is what I ordered the last time I came through and the order that I actually went through making sure I had, never went through. So I ended up with more McDoubles than I needed and about 90% of the stuff I had to put on a second order to make sure my family ate. By then I was not in the mood and no longer wanted my food bc I‚Äôd have to spend more money than I planned if I got my meal plus the extra stuff, not to mention I carefully had put things bundled in meals on the order that should have went through and I had to do things separately now. By then it seemed like the workers were frustrated bc we seemed confused at our order and they just left our Icecream and everything in the pickup inside area even though I ordered curbside both times, even had to type in the 3. So much for trying to save money with McDonald‚Äôs. I hope you can fix the glitches bc this is a good app when it works."
"I‚Äôve now attempted to use this 4 times. The order goes through fine, so maybe it‚Äôs actually just the employees in my town, managers included. The first time I used it, they said they didn‚Äôt have my order, and then charged my card 2 hours later for the mobile order, after I had already placed and paid for a new order at the store. I tried a different location, the first time the manager told me I had failed to pay for my order so I needed to drive back around to the first window and pay. There is NO OPTION but to make payment in app. The third time, not quite as bad, I had to drive up to the window and tell them my order so they could find it. Third time? I was told repeatedly they didn‚Äôt have any mobile orders, I had to go inside to straighten it out. Understand, THERE IS NO WAY TO CHECK IN UNTIL YOU ARE AT THE STORE. It uses GPS to track your location and it won‚Äôt check you in until you are almost in the parking lot. I know, I‚Äôve tried. You literally cannot order from the wrong location, so THEY HAVE TO HAVE YOUR ORDER IF YOU CHECK IN. Even now as I type this, they don‚Äôt show my order as complete. I picked up my order 22 mins ago, according to my receipt, yet the blue bar at the top of my screen tells me they are still tracking my location! Seriously, if you are going to put the time and effort into making an app, take the time and effort to train the employees how to operate the system."
Over engineered and poorly executed.  Downloaded the app and placed my first order.  We were good up to this point.  After placing the order and paying with Apple Pay the app went to a page that told me I had to  tell the app when I was close so that the order would be prepared.  No option to simply say be ready in 30 minutes.  My plan was to place the order and have someone else pick it up.  Not happening if I have to tell it I am close using my phone.  Drive to McDonald‚Äôs where the app tracked my location.  It did not automatically submit the order for preparation when I was near so I am not sure why they needed to track my location.  When I arrived I pressed the I am already here link in the app.  It then popped over to a screen telling me I had to select my pickup option.  Unfortunately the screen which I assume was supposed to have options was blank.  The  employees at McDonald‚Äôs had no idea what to do and didn‚Äôt really care either way.  Restarted the app several time but always ended up on the same blank pickup options screen.  I was able to cancel the order and reorder from the kiosk inside the store until that failed when I tried to pay at the kiosk.  Took me twice as long to get lunch as it would have to just walk in and place my order at the counter.  The reason I rated this app so poorly is not only that it failed to perform but that McDonald‚Äôs is capable of so much better than this.
"This is clearly the best app I‚Äôve used for any fast food restaurant. It works. And I don‚Äôt mean just the app on your device, but the back office operations that are required to fulfill your order.  
The worst bug I experience is after one picks up their food. A day or two may go by, and then when I open to use the app again it hasn‚Äôt cleared out my past fulfilled order, and it automatically reloads the past order into the cart.  Then I have to go manually delete every item that I ordered before, so I can make a new order. Not a giant problem, more like just annoying. 
Not a formal bug, but a design error IMO, As I wish they made it easier to add condiments to an order. I think it should be the last thing selected before a person confirms their order. It‚Äôs easy to forget to add the condiments, then when I pick up my food I ask the personnel on duty for it, and although I get it, I can tell it‚Äôs a tiny annoyance for them - a break in their flow.  
Regardless, I‚Äôm impressed and happy with it. The formalized ‚Äúmenu hacks‚Äù feature to be released soon sounds awesome."
I placed an order selected curbside waited like 20 mins no one comes out or says anything I started calling the drive thru person who finally looks across the lot and I tell him ive been here like 20 mins and no one has brought my food. He has like this shocked little on his face and another lady comes to the window and says can u get in the drive thru line (which by the way has at least 12 card in it). I said do you know how long that line is and I‚Äôve already been waiting almost 20 mins then she said ok as soon as this car finishes I will bring you your food. So I wait and wait and wait. After the 6th car passes no one comes to the window or anything. I was so mad I drove around and got in the drive thru line which is wrapped around the building now. This is the worst customer service ever. You guys should be ashamed of yourself. If I could have gotten my money back from the app I would have left and went somewhere else. No one even apologized they just acted like nothing was wrong. It‚Äôs called fast food for a reason. I can‚Äôt believe I placed an order at 915 and still haven‚Äôt gotten my order as of 956. The building is locked so I can‚Äôt even go in and just ask for my money back. You guys have been in business long enough and should know how better to offer better customer service.
"Kind of funny how this app lets you store payment info and do transactions, but when something goes wrong, there is no support. Good way to steal your money. Their solution is to just contact your bank and dispute it with them. They‚Äôll do the transactions and take your money, but they want no part in giving you customer service for refunds lol. Such a good joke from such a large company. I‚Äôve done the order from app and skip the line and wait at the stall for them to bring out your order. At two different McDonald‚Äôs I had the same experience. No one wants to bring out the food because they are lazy or short staffed so you wait 30 mins to an hour for your food. But your food is made, it is just sitting there getting cold. You can call the number on the sign, but sometimes they won‚Äôt answer or they will say they are short staffed because no one wants to work at McDonald‚Äôs for such low pay and they will try to get it out. 30 mins later you get your order and it is hard cold almost inedible fries, and a completely old sandwich. That‚Äôs where the non existent app support comes in. What do you do if your food is cold and inedible? You get no help on the app for a refund. They just take your money and the McDonald‚Äôs that gave you the cold inedible food will say the app is separate and they don‚Äôt deal with it. So this is a good way to have your money stolen from McDonald‚Äôs."
"There were many times using the app, that provided very good results. However, I‚Äôve also had problems many times when I tried making use of the deals. I would get to the part that I choose the deal that I want. Then the app tells me that I already used a deal so I need to wait for so many minutes, close to an hour, in order to use the deal again. NOTE: I DIDN‚ÄôT EVEN USE THE APP THAT DAY???????? So, I‚Äôd end up just not using the app for my order. I would mention it to the manager but was told that they couldn‚Äôt do anything for me. I‚Äôve complained and even had contact with people from McDonald‚Äôs, but, nothing came out of it. I even received an email which said that the problem was solved. Well, it wasn‚Äôt solved for me. I got so frustrated that I stopped using the McDonalds app and started using the apps from Wendy‚Äôs and Jack-in-the-Box. Sometimes, the Wendy's app doesn‚Äôt work. So, I just go into Wendy‚Äôs and ask if I can still make use of the offer in the app even if it wasn‚Äôt working. To my surprise, they manually process it for me. Just want to mention that Wendy‚Äôs and Jack in the box have really good deals in their apps. Today, I thought that I‚Äôd try to give the McDonald‚Äôs app another chance. But guess what! I couldn‚Äôt use the deal again because the app stated that I already used the deal recently."
"The reason I liked this app was the convenience of ordering food for my kids if they‚Äôre hungry and I‚Äôm at work. They can walk over and pick up their food, and I pay right from my phone. Convenient right? Nope! I ordered from work one day, it was a little confusing and I had to hit back a few times to get the location right, or so I thought... well my daughter walked over, I screenshot and sent her the order confirmation. She‚Äôs waiting and they say no order. So I check the order again and it said it was ordered at another McDonalds down the road and I KNOW I clicked the right McDonalds when I placed my order. Anyways I called both McDonalds to see if they can transfer the order and they were NO HELP! Told me I needed to call the contact number on the app, well I did and was told that the charges are pending but it won‚Äôt clear since I never picked up my order. Today I look and see the charges cleared for $20 worth of food that I never got and McDonalds knows it was never picked up and that I was totally scammed! I call again and I am told I need to dispute the charges with my bank. Are you kidding me? This app is a joke and so is McDonalds. Deleting and never using again! I‚Äôve been using the Starbucks app for years and never had problems like this. McDonald‚Äôs ripped me off of $20! You‚Äôve been warned, do not use this app because even if you don‚Äôt pick up your food, you‚Äôre charged and they don‚Äôt refund you."
"I like the fact that there are awesome deals on the app. The app is user friendly, and I‚Äôve only had a few issues with the map within the app detecting my location. My main issue with the app is that they won‚Äôt fix your food until you‚Äôre actually at the restaurant.  That makes no sense to me at all. I am a very busy person, and using the app doesn‚Äôt save me time, and often times it can be pretty inconvenient to use. I was almost late to work the last time I used it because it took 10 min to bring my food out to me at curbside. I saw cars come and go. I saw walk-ins come and go as I waited on my app order.  They were actually doing to go orders in the store. I would have rather done that, however, there was no option for to go orders on the app. Only curbside or drive thru were offered.

***In response to the developer‚Äôs response to my grievances with this app, I‚Äôd say that I still stand firm that the app needs work. It‚Äôs literally the slowest way to order at McDonald‚Äôs. There are MANY ways this could be rectified.  For instance provide a tracker similar to Domino‚Äôs. You could also provide a tone block for the customer to pick up the food. OR you could allow a customer to check in if they are within a half mile or so to the restaurant. I could go on and on, but you get the drift."
"I really like McDonald‚Äôs food, but what I hate more than anything about McDonald‚Äôs is their stupid double lane drive-thrus that they seem to have built everywhere now. From drivers not knowing how to line up in a fair way, to drivers just being plain jerks and not letting you merge, to the store getting orders mixed up (I have inadvertently paid for someone else‚Äôs meal before realizing it). It‚Äôs a horrible experience that simply discourages me from going to McDonald‚Äôs.

So I thought ordering through this new app would solve that whole debacle and make for a faster, more pleasant experience. Unfortunately, I have yet to be able to successfully order anything. I added one of the daily deals and then tried to order an additional burger along with it, but could only select from breakfast items (it was definitely past breakfast time), so I gave up for that day. A few days later, I tried ordering again, but when I tried to add a new deal, the app says I can only add one deal per order. Sure enough, the deal I had added before is still in my bag, but expired and I couldn‚Äôt for the life of me figure out how to delete it (I‚Äôve since figured it out, but well after the fact). In addition, I could still only pick from breakfast items (again, it was definitely lunchtime) no matter what I tried to do. In short, this app has been completely unusable and I continue to not want to have anything to do with McDonald‚Äôs."
Me writing a review of this app would be almost as bad as you asking me to review the quality of service at your store in Moorestown NJ. Both are equally as bad. I've found countless stores that get everything right all the time but never one like mine. How is it possible to screw up one customers order ten times in a row? Statistically with all the other customers it is impossible. Just like it should be impossible for the app to fail loading every time I try to use the deals section at prime hours but it does. And only then. Works just fine at two in the morning or ten at night. Go figure. But like I said you don't really want to hear all that from me. You need to wipe that location off the map and start with a new store.  Building and all cause it must be cursed. And I've written to HQ and to the actually owner plus the manager for luck. Never heard back which really disappointed me. So now instead of going there several times a week I go to Wendy's or Burger King. And on special occasions I will go to McDonald's but after the attitude the woman gave me at Moorestown I'll probably stop doing that. I broke a cardinal rule. I asked for tenders after nine at night. I once asked at eleven and thought the guy was going to hit me. You'd think if something is that popular you'd order enough to cover the entire day. I guess McDonald's isn't smart enough. Cause that isn't a Moorestown issue. That happens at all of them.
"This app has come a long way and provides what you would expect from it. The deals are useful as well. My one-star off may be more of a problem with implementation on the restaurant level. The app doesn‚Äôt save a whole lot of time because you have to be next to the restaurant to check in anyway. I understand something could come up and prevent you from arriving to receive your order... but with the Starbucks App your order gets started right away (now that app has its own problems, half the time it can‚Äôt find the store I‚Äôm 2 blocks away from, but that‚Äôs another review). Because of this I find myself getting breakfast sandwiches at Starbucks more often even though I would prefer the fresh cracked eggs at McDonald‚Äôs. Maybe put a disclaimer box that people can confirm/check when they order that stipulates that if they are unable to pick up their order within 20 min it will be discarded with no refund offered.  If you enter a busy McDonald‚Äôs nowadays it takes a whiiiile to get your food. Usually I‚Äôll confirm that I‚Äôm at the restaurant on my app but then sit in my car for 10 min before going in -and sometimes end up waiting another 10 min anyway! Just can‚Äôt win. Maybe McDonald‚Äôs menu is just too big for them now."
"I order and pay with app when I get to pick up from the Center st location in Manchester, CT I was told they couldn‚Äôt give me what I ordered unless I paid more. Really???? Why did the app allow me to choose the options I did if it wasn‚Äôt going to go through at pick up. The manager told me he will refund which will take 3 days and I had to pay AGAIN right now for my order eventhough my ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù order was less then what I originally paid. Doesn‚Äôt make sense AT ALL. I feel it was no way my fault the mobile and pick up locations does not do things the same way and ‚Äúthe manager‚Äù couldn‚Äôt honor my Mobile order the company would be losing too much seriously $2-3 is too much to honor. Complete BS. The manager then refunded me before even coming to an agreement on if I wanted my order or not but get this he only partially refunded what I paid I had to waste my time go back again to get him to do it correct. What a waste of my time kids at that point was upset all they wanted was their ice cream but instead they end up with a ruin night. Needless to say I did not order there or will ever again. It‚Äôs a shame especially when we order from that location at least once a week and well over $20 each time. Over bad management and the ability to make a regular customer wanting to return next time. Def will not be using Mobile order again don‚Äôt want another ruin night!!!!!!!"
"I used this app on multiple occasions and it was usually pretty good. But the last time I used the app it took my order, charged my bank, and the McDonald‚Äôs location I was at told me they had no record of my order. I told them it was processed but they just told me to refresh the app and that the bank charge was just a hold that would go away. He was wrong. No I‚Äôm out over $18. DO NOT USE this app. If you do, they can charge you however they want and you‚Äôll be screwed out of funds. I contacted customer services and they just told me to contact my bank or change my password like it was a fraudulent charge. That‚Äôs not what happened, I ordered food, they didn‚Äôt give me anything, I‚Äôm out of money. Other places like Wendy‚Äôs, Burger King, and more have apps that won‚Äôt do this to their customers. Use them instead. The worst part about having an experience like the one I had is that any customer care or app developer support will all say the same thing ‚ÄúSorry, please call this number.‚Äù I spent 30 minutes at the curbside spot waiting and no one came. I then got in the drive thru lane and waited 10-15 min to be told they didn‚Äôt have my order even though I had a confirmation order email and bank charge. So now I have to waste MORE of my time to fix THEIR issue?? It‚Äôs like you get punished for their mistake. Absolutely unacceptable."
"I had this app on my phone for well over a year. Hardly ever experienced any issues other than the occasional hiccup. Then out of nowhere a few months back it just stopped working. It signed me out and ever since then I have not been able to log back in. I‚Äôve tried deleting the app and reinstalling- several times. I‚Äôve checked all possible settings that could be interfering and no fix. It took the developer a good while to finally come out with an update- which I tried again last night since the update was 6 days previous to this post. As soon as I launch the app I get a ‚ÄúApplication Initialization Critical Launch Error‚Äù message and however which way I try signing in from the options to choose from (Facebook, google, etc. ) I get a application login cancelled error. I can‚Äôt even hit reset my password without yet another error message stating they are having technical difficulties. 
I‚Äôve missed out on so many free drinks and money saving coupons due to not being able to utilize this app, which has caused me to not give my business to McDonald‚Äôs as much especially when there are no issues with their competitors apps. 
I surely cannot be the only one experiencing this and would greatly appreciate it if the problem could get fixed."
"I gave used this app a total of two times the first time their system was down so it didn‚Äôt take my order. The second time (my most recent order) I don‚Äôt like the fact that you can‚Äôt add certain things to your meal it allows you to customize your sandwich but only certain things can be added, big Mac sauce is not one of the options. So that sucked. When I went to go pick it up I asked them if they can go ahead and add big Mac sauce onto the sandwich although they said yes they would it was not added. I also tried to order and have it paid for and have someone else go pick it up for me but that‚Äôs not an option as well you have to have your phone with you in order for your order to be turned in to them. Otherwise they can‚Äôt see it at all. I think online ordering through an app is convenient when you can order and have someone else pick it up for you because it‚Äôs already paid for on your end you don‚Äôt have to worry about giving them money. It‚Äôs also good when you place an order and your exact order is made exactly the way you place it, at this McDonald‚Äôs they couldn‚Äôt get it right I asked for a Dr Pepper and a Coke instead I got two cokes shouldn‚Äôt be that hard to read from the screen."
"I used this app quite often. One day I ordered some food on the app as usual. When I was driving into my McDonald‚Äôs parking lot, the blue tracking disappeared. I did not think much as I was going through the drive through, the person said they could not find my mobile order. So I had to order food on the spot. A few days later, I saw in my banking app, I got charged for my disappeared mobile order. So I try to contact the McDonald‚Äôs to get a refund. Took me a long time to find one phone number, the mobile app support line. The person who answered my phone was polite but useless. They could not do anything to issue a refund. And could not tell me what I could do or call to solve the issue. All they could do is to get my feedback on my app experience. There is no channel for me to dispute the order and get a refund. Then I found the receipt for that order in my email, they sent my order to a random restaurant in Chicago which is more than a thousand miles away from me! I call the restaurant with the number on the receipt, the person who answered me was so rude and basically laughed at me for getting a refund for an order from a couple days ago. So this is absurd. The mobile app wrongfully sent my order to a random restaurant, I got charged for things I did not get. And there is no way for me to resolve this issue! What a joke!"
"I REALLY want to like this app. The deals that are offered are great and I love the ease of being able to order and pay ahead, but often this app just falls way too short. For instance, the app is very bad about refreshing. There have been many times where I have wanted to get on the app to make an order and it is still trying to get me to pick up a completed order from weeks before. Even after closing the app entirely and logging back in it still will give me the prompt. 

It will also get stuck when it is tracking your location. I have had instances where it will not let me select that I am at the restaurant because the location tracking hasn‚Äôt refreshed and the override button wouldn‚Äôt work.

Today, I arrived at a McDonalds with an order and a number, and despite saying on my phone that it was received the restaurant couldn‚Äôt find it anywhere. They stated that they had not received any training on the updated rewards app and that it could be glitchy sometimes. While annoying, it is understandable, but I figured I would report the problem to the app developers. I get entirely through writing up the problem and try to submit and it wouldn‚Äôt go through. Turns out, there is an empty drop down box that is required to fill out of the form, so there is no way to submit the problem. Figures."
"A very bad experience...
I ordered my food with the app, which is supposed to make it easy, but instead it was a pain! We made the order on the app and then chose curbside pick up. They don‚Äôt charge your card until you check in. So instead of saying, hey don‚Äôt charge the card because where the only McDonald‚Äôs in the world right now with NO ICE CREAM! They ran the card,  made the food, and assumed having no ice cream was okay because our order was large. No it‚Äôs not and they should have came to our car before charging the card to inform us that our order would not be able to be completed as ordered. Instead they brought all the food out and asked if we wanted a shake or something instead. We asked for a refund instead and were told that since we did not pay at the store they could not refund us and we would have to call online to request a refund. We called online to request a refund and were told they they could not refund us our money and that we would have to call our bank and tell them the charge was not authorized. 
This was a horrible experience that will not be forgotten. This whole process was supposed to be easy and it was not. To top it all off they think a coupon for a $.50 ice cream was going to suffice when we called. How can you offer a shake but not have ice cream? Aren‚Äôt shakes made out of ice cream?"
"I like the app features. Especially now with COVID it is nice to be able to pay thru the app and not exchange cash or cards with an employee, one less point of contact. Being able to select food items at home I am able to casually get everyone‚Äôs order exactly as desired without feeling rushed at the drivethru speaker or deal with bad speaker communication. The app special deals are also nice. 

The problem I‚Äôve experienced every time so far, about 10 visits using the app, every time I try to pickup my app order in the drive thru my local restaurant is unable to complete my order. They always tell me to pull in to curbside and change my pickup option in the app to curbside. I don‚Äôt know if this is an issue with employee training or if there is a problem with the app. I have not tried the drive thru pickup option at any location other than my local restaurant so I can‚Äôt say if the result would be different. The app is still great to have, just a minor annoyance to have this option not work. There are times when drive thru is empty but I still am not able to use that pickup option."
"The app works great for finding deals and using coupons but mobile ordering needs work. I first tried it in May. Submitted my order, opened the app and indicated that I was at the restaurant and waited for my order. After some time I checked with staff and they didn‚Äôt receive the order. They were great and rushed to make my order for me, but the technology was an issue. I complained to McD just so they would know they had something to fix, and they acknowledged the problem and sent me free coupons.
So I decided to try again, it‚Äôs gotta work great by now (Sep). Well, I was at a different location then my local one so I tried to set it to the restaurant I was at. It didn‚Äôt seem to want to, but eventually did. I placed the order and it charged my card, but said my order was being sent to the wrong restaurant. There was no way to cancel the order that I could find. I thought i could just order again but at this point it wouldn‚Äôt let me pick the restaurant and indicated the restaurant was not open even though I was standing in it :/ Well, there is a charge for the order, but if I go to my history of orders there is only the one from May and actually shows my items in the shopping cart!
Ugh, I want this to work because some deals are only for mobile orders, but they really need to find these bugs in the system."
"Used it for a couple months. Always had problems here and there but not too much trouble until tonight. Placed an order and noticed it auto selected the closest McDonald‚Äôs. Not terrible but I wanted to pick one a little further away because I knew the closest one was closed. Changed the location and it popped a warning that they ran out of milk for the Happymeal and I need to select another option. I thought that was great, it instantly told me what wasn‚Äôt available at the new location. Edited my more order and completed it. My wife thought it was weird that it didn‚Äôt give the drive thru option so she reviewed the order. Problem #1 apparently the app override my selected location and revert it back to the closest location. Problem #2 I went back to the app and there is no way to cancel the order. Problem #3 I noticed that it says they were preparing the order which confused me since it specifically doesn‚Äôt let the order through unless you were at the location. This threw me because previously I have been closer and it still wouldn‚Äôt let me place the order until I was right outside the store. I had been right across the street and it wouldn‚Äôt let me say I was there. My only course of action is to let the order sit and wait 3-5 days till the charge post to my card then dispute it."
"I wanted to use this app every time I went to Mickey D‚Äôs but I won‚Äôt and can‚Äôt. I won‚Äôt because it does it save any time. There have been times that I‚Äôve sat in the numbered parking space and watched people I would have been behind in the drive thru line exit the parking lot. Same when I‚Äôve dined in. Are the people in the restaurant sandbagging because they don‚Äôt want to lose their job to a smart phone?  Maybe but all I know is that it hasn‚Äôt saved me any time and usually cost me time. 

I won‚Äôt because my daughter is at the age where a 6 piece nugget happy meal is just right. Unfortunately, the app only has a 4 piece. I‚Äôve sent feedback that the 6 piece is missing and was promised a response but it‚Äôs still not there a month later. I‚Äôm not sure why this is so difficult. Another reason is that I haven‚Äôt found a way to edit my cart or cancel my order. If I order something by accident, there‚Äôs no way to remove it. If I end up not completing my order one time and come back for a new order later, all the stuff I put in earlier is still there. 

In all, it‚Äôs a good concept but poorly executed. I‚Äôd love to use this app all the time but it‚Äôs relegated to a back folder on my phone. Hopefully, someone at McDonald‚Äôs will notice eventually."
"Just tried the app for the first time. I downloaded it earlier today to check out the deals I saw advertised on Facebook. It seemed awesome and looked simple. We had just eaten dinner so I didn‚Äôt plan to use it. 11:30 comes around and I‚Äôm craving something sweet and my husband wanted actual food. We got a Big Mac for $1.00 (it was an offer in the deals section)! That was amazing. Normally he just gets two McDoubles. I love the ability to customize without feeling like a burden. Checkout was easy. On the drive over I was looking to see how pickup worked. I saw that you could pick it up through the drive thru instead of making a worker walk out to you. It‚Äôs late the line wasn‚Äôt too bad. The window girl was nice. It was all around a surprisingly good experience. We go for late night apple pies quite often and are normally turned away due to it being late (meaning they aren‚Äôt making more), or we get them and they‚Äôre dried out and sticky. Tonight they were warm and presumably fresh and it was great. We will definitely use this again! It gives you the price as you go too. No surprises!"
"The app seems to have no flaws or failings. Unfortunately, given its stated purpose (my reading: save time; order ahead; pay without having to make contact with other humans and save your frequently-ordered items to favorites for even greater time-savings all while earning free food with rewards) it isn‚Äôt going to blow the doors off for any end user with average expectations. You will wait. You won‚Äôt feel at all like you‚Äôre saving time and when you edit, ‚Äúcustomize,‚Äù your items and the edits go unread, having no contact payment makes right human errors pretty much not worth correcting but then you e paid for something you‚Äôre not going to eat or drink. Anyway, the app can‚Äôt save you time when the restaurants are mostly under mediocre management and employees appearing like they would give anything to sit down on a lazy boy or text someone who is not a customer or employee of McDonald‚Äôs. With all that in mind, its world away from the catastrophe that is the Chic-fil-a and Wendy‚Äôs apps.  It functions better than Dunkin‚Äô or the chain restaurant apps, too."
"I‚Äôve used the app successfully for months, but a few days ago they ripped me off. The store I chose had decided to close early that night, without apparently notifying the company or whoever controls whether a store is closed on the app. I ordered before I got there, and when I arrived all the lights were on and there were cars in the parking lot- nothing to suggest from a distance that they were closed. So I notified the app I was there, which it acknowledged, and parked curbside. The app even notified me that they ‚Äúsaw‚Äù I was there and would be right out. We waited. After ten minutes we drove through the drive through, and only then saw the closed notice. When I complained to customer service, they didn‚Äôt respond for four days, and when they did respond, suggested it was my fault and that  if I wanted to dispute the charge I could take it up with my bank. It didn‚Äôt seem to matter that they had emailed me a receipt for my money and that I never got any food. I‚Äôm still waiting for my money back. And now it looks like I‚Äôm going to have to either call or visit or something to resolve this- any convenience the app might provide has been eliminated. It‚Äôs just ridiculous considering they have records of all of this- they know they took my money, and they know the order wasn‚Äôt filled because the store was closed. Unbelievable."
"My kids LOVE McDonald‚Äôs and, like it or not, we are there at least once a week for one meal or another. It‚Äôs fast, convenient, clean, close to home, and all the employees are great. Plus the menu is consistent so we always know when traveling that everyone will be happy if we stop there. That being said, the app is AWESOME! There are always coupons and deals that change daily and weekly plus loyalty rewards for their McCafe beverages, which my husband and I order often. We have used the mobile ordering option a few times, mainly when traveling to locate the closest restaurant or when already at a busy resto to save time in line- either way, it‚Äôs efficient & nice that it offers 3 dif ways to pick up your order (drive-thru, inside counter, OR curbside delivery at designated parking spot). I check the app every time we order because even if we aren‚Äôt ordering a particular item that has a coupon, there is almost always a ‚Äúdollar-off‚Äù coupon if your order is over a certain amount and as a family of 4, it‚Äôs usually a minimum of $20. Bottom line: get the app, it‚Äôs well worth it!"
"If I could give zero stars or even negative stars I would. Tell me why I wasted nearly $20 and sat in my car for an hour waiting for food that never came to me because the app changed the location of my pickup to a place in WISCONSIN? I live in MISSOURI. The maps literally said 7 HOURS AWAY. I couldn‚Äôt even cancel my order either, because up until I had checked the app after waiting for an hour, I had CONFIRMED I WAS AT THE LOCATION THAT I WAS ORIGINALLY SUPPOSED TO PICK UP AT. Therefore, it would not let me cancel my order afterwards. I have tried the ‚Äòcontact us‚Äô to leave an official review twice now, only to finally receive an email. I‚Äôm still waiting on an actual response from a ‚Äòteam member‚Äô. I have even tried contacting someone through the direct messages of Twitter only to be told again to send the official review through the website. To be very clear, I have previous receipts in email form of past times I‚Äôve ordered through the app in surrounding Missouri locations. I also have the receipt that was sent to the Wisconsin location, as well as the idiotic screenshot of the location my maps had shown up as 7 hours away. This review will not be changed until I get a refund. AND I WOULD LIKE TO NOT OPEN A DISPUTE WITH MY BANK. PLEASE TALK TO ME LIKE PROFESSIONALS SO WE CAN GET THIS SORTED OUT."
"I gave this 2 stars only because the app was easy to use, but if the app isn‚Äôt in synch with your chosen store, it‚Äôs a waste of time. I had ordered and paid on the app and noted I was picking up via drive thru. I do the same with another fast food app with ZERO issues. I pulled through and like the screen said, told them on the speaker I was there to pick up (and I gave the order number as the screen instructed). The cashier was like, ‚Äúoh you‚Äôre an Uber driver, pull up to the 2nd window‚Äù. Well, I‚Äôm not Uber but I pulled up to the 2nd window getting wild eyes from the car ahead and behind me in line. At the window I tell the worker my order number and show her the screen and she did not have a clue what I meant or what to do. Obviously McDonalds doesn‚Äôt train employees on this app and how to work with it - at least not system wide.  She asked me to pull forward at which time I sat waiting for them to prepare my order as 5 cars behind me in line passed through with their orders. It would have been faster if I had NOT used this app. Moral of this review? Just because there‚Äôs an app doesn‚Äôt mean your location will know how to work with it. Mine wasn‚Äôt rural either. It‚Äôs faster to just go through the drive through normal. I‚Äôve deleted the app. üëéüèºüëéüèº"
"I‚Äôve had this app for about 3 years and it been helpful. There were some bugs at the beginning but that‚Äôs been fixed about about a year ago. This app does the things I need to do just fine. I always use the scannable coupons whenever I arrive at the restaurant they really help me out. Now the negative side of the app. I‚Äôm NOT a fan of mobile ordering, from my recent experience. When I tried it out, it worked just fine, the directions were easy to follow and payed for my food. But when I arrived at the restaurant my order didn‚Äôt exist. I showed them the order, location, online receipt, confirmation number, everything. The manager didn‚Äôt believe me that I can order on my phone and called it a scam. I couldn‚Äôt get my money back and just went home. I didn‚Äôt want to start a fight at a fast food restaurant for $7.41 (that embarrassing). I never used it again after that (mobile ordering). If you teach your employees the correct procedures and actually care how my money disappeared. I might give it a second try. But for now, I‚Äôll stick with scanning barcodes."
"I have used the McDonald‚Äôs app sence it first came out, I have loved it and would even drive out of my way some times to get to it even if I was not planning on going just to get something they had on the app for a really good deal but in the last several weeks they have changed things on the app to having a lot more Mobil pay coupons and a lot less good at restaurant coupons. And even the at restaurant coupons have not been real good ones, used to have ones like buy one any size frappe got one any size frappe free, and you could buy a small one and get a large one for free and now the new coupons are get a dollar off of a large frappe, wow that is a big difference in coupons! Also they are only offering 3 dollars off so much of a order on the mobile pay, I have used that coupon several times when they had it as a at restaurant coupon but they took it away. Don‚Äôt know if they were loosing money by having all those good coupons but I would look at my at restaurant coupons about every day and was eating a lot of McDonald‚Äôs but now that it has changed it don‚Äôt go near as often. Please add all the good at restaurant coupons back!!!!"
"This is unfortunate bc overall the app is so useful. I really want to take advantage of the deals - but this is the second time using it and the second time it said there was an issue with my payment method (nothing wrong with my card) so I had to pay at the register (with that card). I even tried adding another payment option on the fly at the store and the app said it couldn‚Äôt add my other card. (Visa and master card so shouldn‚Äôt be an issue) when I asked the manager if she ran into other customers who had the same issue she just shrugged her shoulders dismissively. I asked if she was familiar with the app and maybe knew of a solution I got same response.
Add to this that a few months ago I had so much trouble just being able to use it bc it took ages for the app to send a confirmation email - I deleted the app twice bc of that. So I was excited this 3rd time when I was finally able to use it and now run into these types of issues. I would give a pass for a mom and pop store that had app issues but this is McDonald‚Äôs...awful.."
"It‚Äôs really annoying that you can‚Äôt be logged in to your account on multiple devices. I know I‚Äôm in the minority, but I have two mobile phones. One is a personal phone and the other is my work line. Every time you log in to your account on one phone, it automatically logs you out of the other phone. Every time you log back in, you have to verify your identity with a link McDonalds sends to your registered email address. I understand the security but I don‚Äôt understand not being able to use multiple devices.  

My wife wanted to order something when she was out the other day but she couldn‚Äôt use our account because the email verification was sent to my email address and she couldn‚Äôt get the link on her phone. I seriously don‚Äôt understand the point of having an account that is tied to a single device.   

The biggest issue is that you can‚Äôt order ahead. You can‚Äôt place an order until you are physically near the McDonalds location. They won‚Äôt start making your food until you arrive and let them know you are there. At this point, it‚Äôs just as easy to go into the store or just do drive-thru. Outside of the deals, it really isn‚Äôt a useful app."
"I downloaded this app because I was tired of the drive-thru getting my order wrong. I figured, if the order was written down and there to read the order would be difficult to mess up. This was not the case. My first order on the app was a customized quarter pounder meal in which every bit of the customization was exactly opposite. I figured first time hiccups. Next go, I placed my order arrived at the store and selected curbside on the app, parked in the #4 spot, and entered my parking spot number in the app. Up popped and acknowledgement that the info had been received and my order was being made. App notifies you that it usually takes five minutes to get your order. 20 minutes later I decided to go back through the drive-thru line (dining room closed) where I learn they never bothered to make my order. 5 minutes later I have my order minus drink and fries. Two minutes later I have everything but my last large fry and a milk for my happy meal. I got the fry and decided to cut my losses without the milk. If the training isn‚Äôt sufficient to employ the technology at a specific outlet; please don‚Äôt roll it out. I‚Äôll take my chances with the drive-thru until I can ween my children of of McDonald‚Äôs and over to the chicken place. They‚Äôll be going cold turkey soon."
"Waited 20 minutes. 4 other people ordered and got served before me. Ask and still didn‚Äôt get order. Ine more people served and I asked to get my money back then I was given order.

I ordered on the app in my car then walked in to pickup order. Went into bathroom first then came out to the pickup order counter. My order was not there. Three people were waiting in line to place their order. All three ordered and started to wait for their orders along with me. First one of them got their order, then the second. After that I asked the counter person about my order. I showed him my order number on my phone. He then walked and looked up at what I guess was a screen showing orders. He then left and went to take a order from another person that came in. After taking this person order he walked over and picked up the third persons order. This left me and the last person that came in waiting for our orders. After a few minutes he handed the order to the last person that came it. At this point I said can I at least get my money back! He then walked over pickup up my chicken sandwich and apple pie, put them in a bag and handed it to me and walked away. Never said a word to me. I just left and as I was getting back into my car the review screen popped up and I entered my first bad review."
"While the convenience of mobile ordering and the consistent deals are amazing. There is much to be desired when it comes to point redemption and the app connecting with the store. There has been at least 3 times where I have ordered something on the app and when I arrive to the restaurant they simply state we don‚Äôt have that item right now. They don‚Äôt offer any refund or substitution that‚Äôs simply all they say. Then I have to reach out to customer service myself to get a refund (the one time I did it) the other two times the order was less than 5 dollars so I just let it be. 

Also how limited the options are for redeeming points is ridiculous! It is simple to give every item on the menu a point value and also I should be able to use as many of the points that I have earned from spending money as I want in one order. I should NOT be limited to only one. That makes no sense once so ever when I spent the money to earn the points! If I have saved 20,000 points that‚Äôs my prerogative I shouldn‚Äôt be penalized for being a frequent customer I should be able to create and use those points on whatever I please off the menu."
"If I go out of my way to download the app, it should be more convenient and saves time, but instead is a bigger hassle than ordering with the cashier. However, there are a couple of refinements that'll bring this up to 5 stars:

1: If I star a location, please use that as a default; the location chooser should have it as a drop-down menu of nearest store, starred store, and perhaps a ""other"" option at the bottom instead of showing the closest location and bringing up the map when you click on it... I get that you choose the geographically closer store, but it's out of my way, but I want the store that is 0.1 miles further but en route of my commute. In its current state, it's actually more tedious to select your starred restaurant.

2. I've emailed about it before; if I've gone through the hassle of mobile order, one perk should be that the food is ready by the time I walk in, especially if my end goal is to not have to wait. However, if I have to order ahead, then check in and wait (I can't check in from home a mile down the street), there is no incentive for me to actually order with the app since it's actually faster to place the order with the cashier."
"Came here last night as well and everything went wrong. First of all they forgot half of the order, so I had to go into the restaurant (AND without a mask as I did not plan on going in) because I walked up to drive through and they told me to come in. So I go inside meanwhile carrying my son‚Äôs ice cream cone that was melting all over and garbage at that point pretty much‚Ä¶ So she said she‚Äôll get me a new one and throws the ice cream cone away and gets me my fries and the right sauce since I got that wrong to you for the nuggets‚Ä¶.And I also ordered extra salt on every item that I ordered so they would hopefully remember to put salt packets in with the order so when I was inside having to get my order I asked them specifically if they remembered and put the salt in the first bag of food and they reassured me yes they did. So I leave, and of course they did not put salt in, and all the first food was of course COLD by then‚Ä¶ but the worst part! I ordered 2 large fries and they barely out any in! Which happens ALL the time. And as expensive as the fries are‚Ä¶ I expect them to at LEAST BE FULL ‚òπÔ∏è I was able to literally dump the two larges together and it made ONE large fry. Not two. So disappointing. Hopefully today is better. Otherwise it‚Äôs not worth the money that we don‚Äôt have. We rarely are able to even eat out."
Was not very happy with service. This store always has issues today I tried curbside. All my food was not there the large fries were only half full and there was no straws for our drinks. Young man who brought it out said he would get someone out to help me  it took them 20 minutes to bring the rest of my food to me and the rest of our food was cold. What happened to your drive thru service whenever you go there they almost always want you to pull front and the people behind you in line gets their food first cause they give it out as they come out instead first in first out then they have to snoop in each bag to see which order is which then if things aren‚Äôt right you have to wait again. When they finally bring my food out and it is still not right. Really frustrating visit. I totally understand being short staff but when all you had to deal with is ‚Äúdrive thru‚Äù and online orders it has got to get better. Lines are horrible one day at 2:00 in the after there was 5 cars that pulled to the side most had 1 sack and a drink they said their timers keeps running if we set at window I don‚Äôt care about a timer if they would do service right there shouldn‚Äôt have to worry about timer and give better service and hotter food. Thanks for your time.
"Update: Stay away from this app and McDonald‚Äôs customer service! I‚Äôm done! They reach out to you like they want to help and make things right. So you click the link they send and it takes you right back to where you first made your complaint or to call the customer service hotline where no one can help you. They send you in circles and don‚Äôt care. They‚Äôve lost me as a customer. 

I was never a huge fan of the McDonald‚Äôs app because you can‚Äôt pay with gift cards for mobile orders, but I did use it for deals sometimes when I went through the drive thru. I can no longer use the app on my phone as it seems it is no longer compatible. I get an ‚Äúapplication initialization critical error occurred.‚Äù All customer service could tell me to do was to ensure my phone was up-to-date and I was using the latest version of the app. I told them the first time I called that I did all of that, even deleting the app and re-installing it. It has now been a week, and I still can‚Äôt log in. The last customer service email just repeated the same thing they already told me. Unfortunately it doesn‚Äôt seem like anyone is able to figure out this issue, and now I have to take my business elsewhere where I can mobile order and pay with gift cards."
"I‚Äôve had nothing but issues with mobile ordering using the McDonald‚Äôs app. First of all it randomly keeps telling me I have internet connection issues when I don‚Äôt. Although I don‚Äôt know if that is an iOS issue or an app issue. Then it loves taking my money without me getting my food üò† It‚Äôs done this around 3 times now and I‚Äôm told by McDonald‚Äôs employees to wait for the money to automatically return to my bank account which it never does. The latest time it took my money, I was at the ‚Äúwe see you‚Äôre here‚Äù alert and it had the normal option to select a pickup. I had to open another app real quick and when I went back to the McDonald‚Äôs app, the screen quickly changed to ‚ÄúThanks for visiting! We hope you enjoyed your experience‚Äù. I never got to choose a pickup option and I was charged for the food that I never received. There was no order number either. That is not acceptable! The app should NOT automatically complete transactions for users and it should save the last position it was at and always allow pickup options. Horrible app programming/user experience. The app and systems need a major overhaul. I complained on the McDonald‚Äôs website and was asked to help troubleshoot the issue. I shouldn‚Äôt need to do that and I‚Äôm very tired of always having to help companies troubleshoot their issues."
"I ordered 3 McChicken sandwiches with the mobile app, 2 original, 1 plain. After paying, I went to pick up my order and I was given 3 original sandwiches. I told the person at the counter that one should have been plain, however they said it came through the mobile app as 3 regular sandwiches. I know I ordered the correct items that I wanted. There should be a way to able to check before paying, what you actually ordered instead of being forced to get what is given to you without the option of being able to check first. When I went to contact McDonald‚Äôs using the app, during this process it required that I give them the location of the restaurant. As I tried to enter the location of the restaurant, I had to go back and finish putting in my contact information. By going back, the screen was cleared of all my typing and I was forced to start all over again! The anger grew! The app was really screwed up and I swore off McDonald‚Äôs because I always order from the mobile app. The mobile app gives deals, price discounts, and other specials which you don‚Äôt get when you walk into the restaurant. I am done with McDonald‚Äôs! There are too many other fast food places that serve excellent food. I have always given McDonald‚Äôs and the McDonald‚Äôs app 5 stars. Those days are now over."
"At the drive-thru, they ask you if you‚Äôre using the app, but then they never hear you say ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù so then you sit there awkwardly for several minutes until they say ‚ÄúPlease order or leave.‚Äù As soon as I tell them I have a mobile order, they panic and tell me they can‚Äôt find the order, and offer to take my order again‚Ä¶however I‚Äôve already paid using the app. If they take the order again, they have to charge you a second time. You can‚Äôt cancel the order on the mobile app once you‚Äôve told it you‚Äôre at the McDonald‚Äôs location to pick it up. Since the app shows your order was picked up, you can‚Äôt get a refund for your non-existent order. Before they offer the mobile app and start insisting customers use it, they need to make sure their locations‚Äô systems are compatible with it, and TRAIN YOUR EMPLOYEES on it! 
I have reported problems multiple times, and all that ever happens is that I receive a voicemail from a manager, but have never received even an offer of a refund for the multiple orders I‚Äôve had to pay for two or three times. I can‚Äôt continue to keep having these problems and reporting them. McDonalds needs to have this figured out by now.

I no longer visit McDonald‚Äôs and never will again."
"I am not going to take blows at an app I have only used a small handful of times, so I don‚Äôt really have much feedback good or bad. I would, however, like to make a suggestion based on a recent experience I have had. I know most apps are location based, and it makes a lot of sense as to why. With how far along technology is coming, I feel like it would be an absolutely wonderful idea to incorporate the possibility of someone trying to purchase a meal for someone in an entirely different state. Especially with the new online dating world growing to be as popular as it is. I know there is risk to this, as there is risk that someone will order something ridiculous and just drive off. Perhaps offer a pre-paid reservation of some sort, allowing the app holder to pay on the spot and not block access based on location. I‚Äôm sure I am not the only person that would appreciate a feature like this. Anyways, thank you for taking the time to read this. I know it may sound a bit redundant or even mundane. It is just something I look forward to in the future."
"Update again: yep, scroll through 5 pages of ‚Äúisn‚Äôt our update app great‚Äù only to get stuck on the last page of that with no way to actually access anything within the app. No menu, no orders, nothing! You would think that a company that WANTS YOU TO BUY FROM THEM WOUOD MAKE AN APP RHAT ALLOWS YOU TO BUY FROM THEM‚Äîbut you would be wrong‚Ä¶so very wrong. 

Update: when it works, it works well. It‚Äôs very buggy though, and there are 3 main problems that I can see right now. - Doesn‚Äôt always restart after an order is complete. Sometimes I have to manually delete every individual item in order to place a new order because the previous order (which was completed) is still there - Coupons don‚Äôt always work. I just tried to use a coupon for the drink that I usually get, and have used successfully in the past, but right now it doesn‚Äôt work. Usually the drink comes up in the list for the coupon but for some reason it‚Äôs. It listed this time, although it has before and it fits the criteria - Contact Us isn‚Äôt working. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm posting my complaints here There is no point in having an app that takes up space but doesn‚Äôt work. I wrote in about it, for the message that my complaint was received, and nothing after that"
"Placed and paid for my order using the mobile app, but when I got to the drive thru was told they had my order but the payment didn‚Äôt go through. The app gave no indication that there was a problem with the order but the cashier insisted the payment wasn‚Äôt applied. So I gave her my bank card only to find out later I was double charged. I have my bank statement, the original receipt from the cashier and the history log on the app itself. My bank won‚Äôt help because this technically wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äúfraudulent purchase‚Äù and the McDonald‚Äôs customer service line suggested I call or go to the location and speak to a manager. The manager wasn‚Äôt there when I called, but someone took a note down with my information. I called customer service again and a report was taken but no resolution yet. While everyone I spoke to was sympathetic and agreed it wasn‚Äôt right to pay twice for one order, they weren‚Äôt able to resolve the problem. Considering this issue, I‚Äôd like to delete my payment information from the app but there doesn‚Äôt seem to be a way to do so. This has been frustrating and I don‚Äôt see how it benefits McDonald‚Äôs to make issues like this so difficult and cumbersome to resolve. I‚Äôm not optimistic I‚Äôll get my money back and it‚Äôs gonna be hard but I‚Äôm not buying another delicious McNugget until I do."
"I was an early adopter of the app and greatly enjoyed the great deals offered.  Deal ‚Äúvalue‚Äù has greatly decreased, but more importantly, the app value guess sunk to delete level.   The app no longer recognizes my credit card and tells store it is declined via the app.  Weird since all other stores accept it.  So I tried to load another card - no cards are accepted - including corporate cards, visa, MasterCard, credit nor debit.  In short the app rejects all cards deemed functional by other stores as well as the issuing institution - so it isn‚Äôt a card issue.  Four McDonalds locations have been tested and they see an app trend where cards are not accepted by the app and must manually run the cards through their system.   So local managed stores recognize an issue, but McD‚Äôs app developers seem to miss it.   I‚Äôve seen increase in solutions on the web - turn off WiFi at store, turn on WiFi, delete and reload app, log out, delete app and reload app with new email and card. I‚Äôve tried about everything -even loading my account on another phone, which still doesn‚Äôt allow me to use the app.  So it has to be locked up in the app profile info somewhere.  McD App developers need to fix it.  For me for now, I‚Äôm done ordering and eating at McD‚Äôs.  The app gets deleted today.  
Hello Chick-Fil-a.  Their app works nicely."
"Finally, after eight months, and longer for may others, McDonalds finally fixed their app, which had been completely unusable.  It boggles my mind how a multi-billion dollar company let this issue go on as long as it did.  I, for one, refused to go to McDonalds if I could not order through the app.  Since McDonalds only allows you to use their deals if you use the app, there‚Äôs no way I was going to pay more for something knowing it‚Äôs cheaper through the app.

Even though the issue is fixed, I‚Äôm still leaving my rating at one star for now since this was an issue for so long.  Also because this incident has illustrated just how bad McDonald‚Äôs customer support is.  I called and emailed multiple times since the issue started and all they would tell me is that I should make sure I‚Äôm using the latest version of the app and iOS and to try uninstalling and reinstalling the app, which of course didn‚Äôt work.  One supervisor I spoke to even told me it was an issue with my phone and that I needed to get a new one.  Give me a break.  They clearly knew about this issue but refused to be open about it, instead just blaming the customers.

We‚Äôll see if this fix lasts.  Maybe in a few months if everything is still going well I‚Äôll increase my rating."
"This app is terrible! It gets 1 Star for it working sometimes in store.  However, when you have an app only deal that‚Äôs when problems begin.  The majority of the time I get the payment failed message.  On one occasion where this has happened, I received a ‚ÄúThank You For Stopping By‚Äù email over an hour later.  I checked my bank account and sure enough I had been charged the full amount even though I had been trying to order with a deal.  Another occasion I was in store waiting for my food when I saw two charges come across my screen as Apple Pay notifications.  That time I at least got the deal even though I didn‚Äôt want an extra order, but had the charges not come across my phone as push notifications I would have been none the wiser until much later.  I opened a slam dunk case with mobile support over two weeks ago and they still haven‚Äôt gotten back to me.  They were kind enough to send me vouchers to replace the meal I never got, but I still think I still deserve a refund or another meal voucher - one as compensation and the other as an apology.
And my final complaint about the app is sometimes just by viewing a deal I‚Äôm told I‚Äôm ineligible to use it for another 59 minutes.  Scratch this app.  It‚Äôs time to start over!"
"First and foremost the app has issues with charging my cards entered into it. While this was an issue, I‚Äôve managed to work around this due to the Apple Pay option which is a major plus. I‚Äôd much rather it use an intermediary rather than my card info directly. 

Despite that I‚Äôve managed to make regular orders without a hitch. One major aspect I find lacking both in the kiosk order and the mobile app is the fact I can‚Äôt do simple customizations like substitute sauces. I for one am not a major fan of ketchup on my burger. Besides mayonnaise I typically have no other options. Whenever I buy a McDouble at the store I always add Mac sauce instead of ketchup and I‚Äôm willing to pay the extra fee if the need arises. But despite doing exactly what it‚Äôs advertised, I feel it fails in something that may not be common sense but is definitely important. Due to this and the failure with the cards the app definitely falls short of going above and beyond what I had expected. 

P.s. this isn‚Äôt meant to be critical of the deals but rather the lack of creativity it offers"
"I have had the McDonald‚Äôs app on my phone for years but rarely use it except when I am traveling to find the nearest store location.  Today, I just wanted to enter an entry token to their latest game.  Should be easy, right?  WRONG!  It asked me to log in or register.  One option was to log in with my email.  I tried that, using what I know was the correct password.  No dice.  So I tried logging in with my Google account, again using what I know is the correct password.  Instead of logging me in, it took me to a registration process and came back with an error that this email is already associated with a McDonald‚Äôs account and to please log in.  Dummies, that‚Äôs what I was doing!  Why did you send me to the registration process when I picked log in?!  So I selected ‚Äúforgot password‚Äù thinking it would send me a link to reset it, but alas no.  It told me to log into my Google account, where I was already logged in HELLO!  So I decided I would just contact McDonald‚Äôs through the app to tell them of this issue.  That doesn‚Äôt work either.  It never let me select anything from the 2nd dropdown and effectively stopped progress.  The keyboard also never comes up to actually let me type anything.  Big fail, McDonalds.  Guess I will just delete your app since the only thing it is good for is finding a nearby store!"
"I downloaded the app so I could order ahead, and have my order ready to pick up when I got there, so as to reduce the sitting around time. 
I followed all the instructions, and when I arrived at the location it told me to go to the pickup parking spots. There was a sign with an arrow pointing at a parking spot, so I dutifully parked in it. 5-7 minutes later, I decided to go inside to see what the holdup was. When I asked, a lady quite rudely pointed outside (opposite side of the building to where I had parked) and said I was not at the right spot. When I told her I was in the park that the sign was pointing at, she just said ‚Äòthat‚Äôs a sign pointing the way‚Äô. When I told her it was pointing at the Park, and I was really disappointed I had to go inside, given that the whole point of ordering ahead was to avoid going inside and save time, I received a very short ‚Äòoh. Sorry‚Äô. 
I‚Äôm not a rude person, and I feel like I wasn‚Äôt rude in this occasion. The whole exchange, even the lack of a hint of wanting to make it right or mildly apologetic for the inconvenience (and yes, when you‚Äôre desperately trying to get food when you‚Äôre on the way to somewhere and you don‚Äôt want the 2 year old to fall asleep before she eats, and you don‚Äôt want to have to get all 4 kids out of the car, it‚Äôs an inconvenience). 
The app failed spectacularly in my opinion"
"Just wanted some fries. App shows deal- free large fries just for downloading the app. Great!! Click on the deal- order a sandwich along with- click to pay- first problem: My friend was going to pick up the order for me- Nope- app says make sure to bring your phone to check in so looks I‚Äôm going (I still have to go thru the drive thru to give them my order confirmation number so ‚Äúchecking in‚Äù just seems to have one‚Äôs food just sitting there getting cold- so really unnecessary that I go- friend could have given the confirmation number same as I did. But the fun has just begun because guess what? The fries somehow aren‚Äôt on the order. I know they were put thru- it‚Äôs how I started the order- but then fine - whatever- just add them on, I‚Äôll pay... the order has to be refunded then redone? Why? Just do the fries separately. Why is this so complicated? In all fairness, the workers there were great. But the app- what a mess!! Even attempting to add the fries on while in line waiting - no go- looks like it‚Äôs getting added in but check on the final page - not there. Checked to see if our McD‚Äôs participating? Maybe it‚Äôs one of those things - no, our McD‚Äôs is listed as participating. Deleting the app. Not using this garbage again. Whatever. Don‚Äôt really like McDonald‚Äôs food anyway."
"The app is easy to use and very convenient however I can not seem to figure out how to delete or update payment methods. I had a card expire and need to update it but am unable to do so, I tried adding as a new payment method thinking it would override the one already saved but it did not. So I just added a completely different card.
Also, one time when I ordered for a specific store it changed to a store that was closer to my location when I checked out, which was very inconvenient as it was located inside of Walmart and no drive thru or curb side was available. I had spoke to the manager and requested for the transaction to be reversed since it was not suppose to go there and was told I would have to come inside to do that. Yes, I got mad since I didn‚Äôt want it to that location in the first place and to top it off was told it could take several days for the refund to go through.
It eventually was refunded and I have used the app since then but now I double check before I complete the transaction that it is for the store I am wanting it to be at.
And, that is the only issue I have ever had when using the app."
"The McDonald‚Äôs mobile app is one of the easiest and most efficient fast food apps I‚Äôve used. Not once have I had issues processing a payment, and with other companies apps this has happened several times. 

Being able to accumulate points for purchases now is wonderful as well, but I have to withhold a star for the update to the McCafe rewards. As nice as it is to be able to use points I‚Äôve received for buying food items towards McCafe drinks (rather than the old buy five McCafe items get one free system), the fact that we can only redeem these points for frappes or iced coffee is extremely disappointing. If I buy multiple lattes or americanas, I would very much like to receive a free latte or americana, not a frappe. Nearly 15,000 points accumulated on my coffee drinks alone and they‚Äôre essentially useless to me because of this setup. It doesn‚Äôt make much sense to me, considering the reward could easily be listed as ‚ÄúMcCafe Drink‚Äù with the option to choose which type after selecting it (as it is for lots of other deal/reward items). I‚Äôm hopeful this is changed soon."
"I don‚Äôt understand why McDonalds will spend millions of dollars creating an app and have absolutely no interest in a customer reporting issues with the app.  Virtually every time  I make a purchase, my card gets charged multiple times and still will not process the order. I have both Discover and AMEX cards affected the same way. In fact Discover said this is very common issue with the app but the fix is a McDonalds problem.   I have reached out multiple time via the ‚Äúcontact us‚Äù to no productive results. Yes, I get a non monitored form email.  Yes, they give a phone and case number.  I have spent nearly an hour total on hold with no answer from their ‚Äúbusy staff‚Äù.  One time I received a for your trouble gift card.  All I had to do was call the non answered number to provide my address. The app and the deals brought me back into McDonalds, wonder why there is no interest in keeping coming back?  I have tried to delete app and reload. But the cloud returns same flawed app. I have tried to delete the two cards and reload, but figure out how to do it."
"Terrible. Can‚Äôt pick a local store and find deals, order, etc. - unlike all of their competitors - without changing my location settings so McDonalds knows where I‚Äôm at 24/7. Ordering online is useless. It takes more time to wait in line to pick up through the drive through and even more to go inside than just wait in the regular drive through and get it fresh (sort of). Sent a comment to McDonalds about these and other issues but the app doesn‚Äôt allow contractions (I‚Äôm, you‚Äôre, doesn‚Äôt, etc), copying, special characters like @, etc. when I finally finished my message it wouldn‚Äôt accept it because I was 10 characters over the limit. Edited it and it wouldn‚Äôt take it because I didn‚Äôt specify what version I was using which required closing the app and having to retype my message, name, phone, account info all over again. Wasted an hour and instead got a Big Fish from BK - twice the size, better quality and 25% cheaper - from the Burger King app without any of these problems."
"First time user of the app. As far as food apps go, I found this one very user friendly compared to so many others. It had answers for every question I had plus others I didn‚Äôt think about. My only issue isn‚Äôt  actually from the app but more McDonalds. My experience once I ordered was terrible. I ordered and paid, so why can‚Äôt the order be started before I arrive in my parking space. Totally defeated my reasons for using curbside. Order was delivered missing food. Had to leave my dogs in the car and go inside taking my food with me. Got back to my car and my requested picante sauce was missing. Left all the food in the car with my dogs praying they wouldn‚Äôt eat it. Finally get home, the bag with the sandwiches and all the butter and syrup ended up with a whole in the bottom , from I guess the steam, no straws and requested no ice, got ice. Shocker! The order took a long time, no faster or easier than drive thru. What‚Äôs the point of curbside??? I was really excited to get breakfast. It‚Äôs been a long time. The food was as I remembered but experience was awful."
"I enjoy this app until now I can only use some features on here.. now found it not comp to my üì± 6splus.. that‚Äôs crazy, I could see Apple stop  support software like the 4 model.. I went out to buy new phone for that reason, I don‚Äôt have issue with it why buy new phone. This is only Fast food app I have issue with if Wendy‚Äôs,BK, Sonics,  can support these models.. so Mcdonalds should be able to..they make millions of dollars off us .. can‚Äôt even support our phone..why buy phone if not broken üò† and lot people can‚Äôt afford one while people are without jobs.. I hope u guys listening to our voices. I rate this app 4.. only reason  is bcz u set a limit on 1 coupon in hr , to me it should be 2... ur the only app that does this Wendy‚Äôs, Bk,Sonic don‚Äôt have limit ... when u have family , example, u get bogo ,then u have FF for1$ or free w purchase.. then u have McFlurry bogo half off..or frappe 1$ off so u have to wait an hour try complete a meal, even tho u have to make purchase to get it , not like a free item only , I can see restricted a free item,1x, but again u should allow 2 or 3 least. Maybe ur using a coupon for ur self, then using one for child..  plz reconsider at least 2x...thanks"
"We order from MDs a few times a week. Out of these times about half the time the order gives us issues, whether it‚Äôs the most common one of the order ‚Äúnot showing up‚Äù either because I ordered it for someone in my family so my device won‚Äôt let me check in for them, and then there‚Äôs the issue of when they can‚Äôt find the order and I‚Äôm having to repay for the order I already paid for (and the employees at MDs say ‚Äúwere not affiliated with the app, call this number ‚Äú so then we call the number, and we get told by some sassy southern woman ‚Äúlet me stop you there. we don‚Äôt refund, you‚Äôll  have to call your bank‚Äù well my banks never done this to me-BUT MCDONALDS SURE HAS!! And so were clear, this happened AGAIN, AFTER the update, just at dinner Time last night. ( December 11th). Me and my family have been saying this for a few weeks now, but finally after the supposed update yesterday and still the problems, WE ARE FINISHED WITH THE APP. Order anywhere else for the kids while your busy/ at work, or they‚Äôll just be yelled at, and ultimately go hungry until you order elsewhere....and definitely don‚Äôt trust this app when your trying to relax so you online order and send your wife only for her to be upset frustrated and treated like crap."
"Choices choices....while the ‚Äúdeals‚Äù component of the app offers a treasure trove of treats, having the option to combine some of the offerings into a single transaction would improve the overall guest experience. Currently only one treat can be acquired from the lineup per transaction. My daily routine is an amazing McCafe caramel Mochiatto hot with whole milk. Buying five earns the guest a free McCafe beverage! Lovi‚Äôin that! However, if I choose to take advantage of any other deal during that transaction, my McCafe credit is canceled out in Lieu of the new deal selected. My dilemma is do I choose the McCafe credit or an optional deal??? Or make the single transaction a multiple transaction experience; taking advantage of other options in the lineup. How stressful and time consuming!! Can I suggest deals that require multiple purchases in order to be rewarded with a future treat be a totally separate rewards program. Putting the guest in an either-or situation takes the joy out of the experience. I‚Äôm very needy....I want my McCafe credit and my morning deal on a single transaction! Now that‚Äôs something to love!!!-Mark D from Atlanta"
"I mobile order ALL THE TIME on my Chick-fil-a app, so I was hoping for the same ease of experience with this app. I should have known the bar had been set well beyond reach. I used the app, paid for the food, received a receipt and headed to the local restaurant. I pulled in the space, pulled up the app and followed the instructions. Waited 10 minutes and then decided I would pull thru the drive thru. When I told the lady I completed a mobile order she said they did not have the order. We confirmed I was at the correct restaurant. She escalated the issue to the manager. The manager stated that they did not have my order and there was nothing they could do for me. I advised I could show her the receipt and where the money had already been taken from my account. She stated they preferred people not use the app and the only thing I could do was place an order and pay for it. When I reached out to Customer Service they apologized and said they could not refund the money I would have to contact my bank for a refund. They did send some Arch Cards for a free fry, drink and sandwich for my inconvenience. Fortunately, after I contacted my bank I was refunded the money. However, it was a mess!  Please save yourself the trouble and do not use this app."
"I had to revise my review and subtract a star because for the past three weeks or so each time I‚Äôve attempted to complete an order that included one of the app exclusive deals, an error message pops up saying that my transaction could not be completed because my device went offline, however the processing of the charge still went through. That‚Äôs not a huge deal as the charge gets refunded once I cancel the order but then I can‚Äôt access that deal again until the time restriction elapses...which still doesn‚Äôt matter because the same error message pops up without fail. I don‚Äôt know if this only happens when you try to use one of the deals because I only use the app when I want to use a deal, which was the entire incentive for me downloading the app to begin with. I‚Äôve tried deleting the app and then downloading it again on two separate occasions to see if that fixes the problem but the issue still persists. Until it‚Äôs fixed I‚Äôll just have to take my business to food chains who‚Äôs apps actually work"
"I‚Äôm not even a real frequent McDonalds customer, but with 3 boys (all 10 and under) the ordering process in store or at the drive through is kind of a pain. I‚Äôm hate having to stand there feeling like I‚Äôm holding up the line because my kids are indecisive about what they want to eat. This  app completely changed my McDonalds experience. It was simple, easy, visual. The kids could tell me what they wanted and how much just by pointing. And because the next time we order (whether on the road during travel, or the occasional weekend visit) we‚Äôll have the entire thing saved on the app. Just had to click a button when I arrived in the store and the order was already being made when I walked in. One piece of feedback. I like pickles a lot and usually I say ‚Äúheavy pickles‚Äù when ordering and they get the hint. The app only allows you to select up to 3 pickles (3 is the highest number allowed). So that‚Äôs exactly what I got, three pickles. My minimum for a ‚Äúheavy pickle‚Äù is way more than 3. A better way to order pickles would be (regular,  none, or heavy)."
"Contact us NOT WORKING AFTER CHOOSING SMART PHONE 
YALL HAVE SEVERAL PROBLEMS WHO IS. IN CHARGE THEY ARE AN IDIOT

FIRST what do you care if an offer extended to a customer that they make use of of it at one visit or at an impossible time like an hour later. That‚Äôs retarded.  Who is retarded.  An executive fool.  Your objective is lost.  Fool.  It should be spending money or reading the UNITED STATES interest in the menu.  But somebody assigned an idiot.  I will never go to McDonald‚Äôs with deals but i can only make use of an hour apart from each other so I‚Äôd prefer just not come at all.  The purpose of the deals was to attract customers to or back to the restaurant across the United States.  Why cause until you changed the use of deals i have not really wanted to visit.   I prefer to eat a complete meal in my kitchen.  Check your records i bet you revenue has dropped.  Idiots you had outrageously long lines now you siphoning off your customers.  Idiots.   We customers are no fools if your target is us.   Otherwise y‚Äôall are idiots cause you‚Äôre not gaining or maintaining your customers you‚Äôre alienating.  I could be wrong but like most large corporations i bet y‚Äôall arrogant so i wish y‚Äôall the best but you‚Äôve lost all of me and all the your customers I recommended make use of your McDonalds app.  Retarded idiots."
"This app does not work the way Starbucks or other mobile ordering apps do. With Starbucks for example, you order, pay, and the order is started no matter where you are, and they prepare your coffee while you travel to the location so it is ready when you walk in the door. With this McDonalds app, it makes you THINK your order has been placed but it doesn‚Äôt process your payment until you are in the vicinity of the restaurant, which means they don‚Äôt start making your food until you are already in the parking lot ready to grab and go. This Defeats The Entire Purpose Of A Mobile Ordering Service. People want to save time on the way to work or during lunch break, just avoiding the drive thru / cashier is not enough. I‚Äôve tried this at two different locations in my area, and I‚Äôve had to wait more than 5, sometimes more than 10min to get my food AFTER I placed the order (which I could not place until I was within the vicinity of the building). I‚Äôm just gonna go ahead and delete this app because it doesn‚Äôt seem like this is a small thing they can just debug; this is an intentionally designed point-of-sale flaw that would need to be rewritten at the corporate level. 

üñïüèºI‚Äôm NOT lovin‚Äô it.‚Ñ¢Ô∏è"
"I love the app and all the deals that are offered! You guys did something right! I use this app like 2-3x a week! One of the few, probably most annoying thing and the reason I rated y‚Äôall 4 rather than 5 stars? The layout of the drink options, specifically with the McCafe/smoothie drinks, when selecting for mobile ordering.  HOLY MOLY, talk about annoying! I had to scroll through basically the whole thing, speed reading wasn‚Äôt much help because there‚Äôs SO many and disorganized ‚Äî like DANG! So much for if you‚Äôre in a hurry. NOPE, better sit tf down! Never mind if you‚Äôre just trying to get to work...on time. You gotta scroll for 2+mins just to find your drink! My suggestion would be to group all the beverages according to type; i.e. scroll. BAM, all the coffee (if I see a M Caramel Macchiato, I should see L Caramel Machiatto right beneath it...not another 2-3 options down üôÑ)..scroll some more. BAM, all the smoothies...sorted by beverage AND size. So as y‚Äôall are trying to promote mobile ordering and looking for feedback, please consider this!"
"Works at first with great selection, simple ordering. Access to deals. As well as a streamlined pay and pickup procedure. The problem comes when you get one problem with the payment with Apple Pay. The application does not let you change the payment. You may be able to cancel the order. But then the app ‚Äúlooses connection ‚Äú. Whether on wifi or cellular data, you can‚Äôt log in again, you can‚Äôt create a new login. Close and restart the app many times, turn the iPhone off and back on. Uninstall and reinstall the app. None of these worked! I had to erase my phone and reinstall everything (not from backup) to get the app to work again. It worked fine until I again had a payment issue. Then the issue started all over again. Worse, is the only way to order is through the app, so I can‚Äôt just go to the website. After a year and a half of seeing this issue. I‚Äôve opted to just not having the app installed."
"I‚Äôve used mobile ordering four times and three times, it has double charged me for my order. The issue is that when I get close to the McD location, i complete the transaction on my app and pay for my order. When I get to pick up my order, the staff tells me my order did not go through and I need to process payment again. Some times, that means redoing Apple Pay on my phone, and other times, it means paying cash/ credit at the register. Each time, when I check my credit card statement, I see the original transaction processed. I‚Äôve had to dispute the charge through my credit card company. This is a big problem, esp because you are forcing customers to use mobile pay to have access to coupons. If the payment issues with mobile ordering did not exist, I would be more interested and likely to visit McD. However, with these issues, it will be once in a while and definitely not with using mobile ordering until this gets fixed.

McD - read the reviews here. There are a lot of other users who have reported similar or other issues with Mobile Ordering and many of your recent reviews have been very poor lately. You have not updated the app in about a month. Are you listening to your customers?"
"No it‚Äôs just y‚Äôall are constantly ruining yourself. I use the app when I‚Äôm hungry to see if there‚Äôs good coupons out then you figured that it wasn‚Äôt right to have people scan coupons there so you made it a mobile order only option to use them, goodbye people who use cash cause they don‚Äôt want to use a card, and now I can only see them when I‚Äôm next to a McDonald‚Äôs you know the part where I‚Äôm ready to receive my order now I have to wait in line just to see if that good coupon is there and leave if it‚Äôs not wasting my time and confirming my suspicion that y‚Äôall aren‚Äôt gonna have any good coupons anyway. 
Not only is this coupon app gone bad but so have y‚Äôall employees they don‚Äôt know how to handle the mobile orders they lack the training and the amount of employees to handle moble order I shouldn‚Äôt have to tell them I made a moble order they should do it like all the other orders and just shout the number when it‚Äôs ready. I guess I‚Äôll just use good old burger king who has better coupons that are in the app and, get this, on paper from the mail. Y‚Äôall lost the marketing competition fix it or pack it up and blame the millennials on your way out, your only saving grace is if you don‚Äôt have any competition on the block."
"This app is so bad it should be a sin. First of all, I don‚Äôt even trust the coupons anymore because anytime I go to use them they never work correctly. The coupons also don‚Äôt give details that are important such as the fact that milkshakes are now considered a McCaf√© item because of the McCaf√© rewards program. However, if you go to use a BOGO coupon for the McCaf√©, they tell you that the milkshakes are not part of the deal even though it doesn‚Äôt say that. Then they‚Äôll play a game called ‚Äúwe‚Äôll try the coupon if you want‚Äù but then they don‚Äôt tell you that they charged you incorrectly because it didn‚Äôt scan right and you‚Äôre the one who gets screwed even though it‚Äôs the chains fault. Then there‚Äôs the ordering. Oooohhhh god how many times it tells me that ALL OF THE RESTAURANTS ARE CLOSED but they aren‚Äôt! So I can NEVER order food on the app and I‚Äôm FORCED to either do drive thru or pick up inside and wait in line or pay for someone else to bring it to me. Then when they have the sweepstakes and you win it‚Äôll have s button for redemption, however it never works. Emailing customer service is useless; they never answer! I‚Äôm to the point that idk if I‚Äôm even going to continue going to McDonald‚Äôs because of how bad this made the customer service both in and outside the app!"
"This app sure does make it SOMEWHAT easy to place orders with McDonald‚Äôs. I rarely used to eat here but now I find myself frequenting this place a lot more just because there‚Äôs an app, and apps are fun. It‚Äôs frustrating though, that there are multiple steps to get your order processed. You can place an order on the app, then you have to wait until you‚Äôre at/very near the restaurant & have to go into the app again to complete the ordering process & that‚Äôs when they start to put your order together. So you STILL have to wait for them to get the order ready. If you have to turn on location services for the app, why can‚Äôt this information be integrated in the ordering process to make it easier & more efficient?? It doesn‚Äôt make this app as user-friendly/effective as the other eateries‚Äô - you‚Äôre still having to wait until you‚Äôre there before they actually begin to process the order. Also, can you please allow for mobile orders to pay using McDonald‚Äôs Gift Card in the app? I received one as a gift, but I can only use it by ordering inside the restaurant which defeats the purpose of the app."
"A lot of us don‚Äôt order a happy meal cause our children like more fries or more nuggets than what comes in a happy meal, so we order the items separate in bigger sizes & with the kids still wanting the happy meal toy we order just the happy meal toy for around $1.75. The app has an option to order everything except the happy meal toy though. Can you please add the option to order the toy on the app. When ordering on the app i know for myself personally the people at the window get extremely rude when asked to add the toy on to the order even though all they have to do is add the toy & it gets charged to the card on the same order & a separate order don‚Äôt have to be made. Don‚Äôt know why it makes them so angry but it does. Me & a lot of others would just like to have the option to order the toy in the app. For me personally it‚Äôs so I don‚Äôt have to worry while waiting in the drive through line if im going to have to feel uncomfortable asking to simply order the toy at the window cause some of the window cashiers get very worked up about the simple question to add the toy to the order."
"I still give the app a 4-star rating because I literally use it daily and am able to snag a deal on something. I didn‚Äôt give it a 5 because the app has issues with loading sometimes so I‚Äôll have a coupon ready but when it‚Äôs time to scan it, it doesn‚Äôt load. It‚Äôs almost like sometimes the app flukes on purpose when you actually arrive at a location. Secondly, the coupons I do see everyday (recently) have been the same ones. When I first downloaded the app there were a variety of different deals everyday and now it‚Äôs like the developers have gotten lazy or something. Though, I don‚Äôt wanna complain because the free drink or $1 any coffee, and the McCafe rewards are great! And lastly, I‚Äôm not sure why they stopped it (probably because the majority kept voting the same deal every day) but for about a month they had a voting poll where you could vote on what deal you‚Äôd like to use the next day which was great! They should bring that back but switch up the items a bit more so people aren‚Äôt voting for the same thing every day. Still a great app nonetheless!"
"When McDonalds first launched their app, I was a happy and loyal customer using it  more frequently  than any of my other food apps. There were a few glitches but nothing major. However a few months ago-October 2020, the app started malfunctioning very badly. It had signed me out and I wasn‚Äôt able to sign back in. As soon as I start the app it had an error message citing technical difficulties and to restart the app- which I did. It still wasn‚Äôt working. I tried everything- uninstalling then reinstalling, logging in different ways, even creating a new account. NOTHING WORKED. The app was still malfunctioning. I contacted McD with my concerns multiple times and received nothing more than some cookie cutter responses. Now today I tried ONCE AGAIN to use my app and now it won‚Äôt even load. I uninstalled it then reinstalled it. Still not loading up. It‚Äôs the worse it‚Äôs ever been. I only gave this review 2 stars instead of 1 because I Really Liked the McDs app. It was fun and had great deals. I hope SOMEONE that is able to fix the app reads this review so the problem can be rectified.  Then I can write a better review on how great it‚Äôs working."
"This happens AT LEAST 3x/wk. I‚Äôll pull up to the drive thru speaker, the cashier says ‚ÄúHi just to let you know our systems are completely down‚Äù (which was the excuse this time) so they didn‚Äôt make the order I placed through the app 30 min prior and I‚Äôd like to point out that this was my first time ever using the mobile app. The app also doesn‚Äôt let you know which locations are currently able to process said orders so I just drove over there in the cold for literally nothing. And from previous experiences without having an already placed order they also say ‚ÄúHi just to let you know our systems are down and we‚Äôre only accepting cash‚Äù and ‚ÄúHi just to let you know our systems are down and we‚Äôre only accepting cash and we are only serving breakfast‚Äù oh and their ice cream machine is conveniently always broken or shut down. Mind you I always come between 11pm and 5am so that‚Äôs definitely a wide enough range of time to see some sort of pattern to know what times to avoid but they deny orders solely because they don‚Äôt want to make them. And I‚Äôm done. I know McDonalds could give a McSh*t less if I stopped being a customer but hopefully some negative reviews all over social media will get the attention of someone higher up to do something about it."
"One bad experience, you know how that goes. I tried to give feedback via the app itself and got locked out of that so here I am. Two nights ago, I ordered on the app and paid, no problems there. When I got to the restaurant, they said they didn't have a mobile order despite my having a confirmation number. I hard closed the app and reloaded it, and they got my order however they showed it unpaid, so I had to give them money again just to get food I had already paid for. I showed the management team member where on the app it showed it had been paid for and on my banking app where it had been debited and she said I was going to have to talk to corporate and/or dispute the charge with my bank but i was not going to be given my food until I paid for it again. It's not about the money, it was inconvenient making for a long back up behind me in the drive thru and if I'm honest it was a bit embarrassing. Figure that glitch out and fix it for others. I will probably be giving the app a little space and finding a new location to go to as well."
"I like your app, and all the rewards you get with it. That being said, it has a couple bugs that need to be worked out of it. 1. Sometimes when I order with the app, after completing my order and clicking to make payment, it will tell me an alert that a couple of the items in my order are no longer available as the discount deal I had entered, even though that deal said it was for today. And it won‚Äôt let me place my order. If I decide to go through and delete all my items and start the order again exactly as I did before, it will put my order through with no further problems, allowing the discount deal to work. 2. Other times after I place a mobile order and click payment it all looks fine, but when I get to McDonald‚Äôs, I find that my order has disappeared completely. I don‚Äôt know why, but it has happened several times. I don‚Äôt know if anyone else has encountered these problems, but I hope you guys can fix it on your end. If so, I‚Äôll give 5 stars! Thanks!"
"So, I downloaded the McDonald‚Äôs app thinking I was gonna get amazing deals and not have to wait in long lines. But, that‚Äôs not what happened. Every single time I download this app, it says NO restaurants are available to order at. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. The reason being, was that it was due to my ‚Äúlocation‚Äù. I tried the McDonald‚Äôs app in so many places I could count on both my hands and nothing. It says the same thing no matter where I am. I work at McDonald‚Äôs and I‚Äôve even tried using the app in the break room, still nothing. I even configured with my phone‚Äôs settings to try and fix the problem, still nothing. I download, uninstalled, and updated this app a million times and nothing worked. I contacted customer service, and all they said was it was my phone carrier that is causing this problem. I talked to my phone carrier, nothing, they said it was caused by the app. So I‚Äôm stuck here, coming back to this app every 1-2 months trying it again and nothing has changed. So, let‚Äôs just hope that you don‚Äôt have the same problem as me."
I was exciting about this concept and wanted to try it today at lunch. My excitement died shortly after I had pulled up to the mobile order parking space and entered my checkin information on the app. (You can‚Äôt go through drive thru the first time you use a card). After 15 minutes I felt a little helpless and at 25 minutes I finally walked into the store. When I asked the employee at the counter what the status of my order was since I‚Äôd been waiting at the mobile parking space for 25 minutes. She said if it‚Äôs been 25 minutes they probably put it there. (She was pointing at the trash can). She continued working during our conversation and when she came back to the counter I had to clarify that I meant the mobile ordering in the parking spaces outside. She asked what the order was and said that she didn‚Äôt have it on her screen. I told her I had the confirmation and that I had followed the app and had an email too. She made me my order in less than 2 minutes and said please rescind your other order. There was nothing to rescind since my order was already charged and waiting. Terrible service and response. I waited 30 minutes for nothing and I will definitely tell others to avoid this app service. Terrible terrible service.
"The forts problem I had, was when it was raining. I decided I‚Äôll be nice and not make make them walk out in the rain for curbside, because I found a parking spot right at the door. Went to check in, and the app would not tell me my payment went through. Went and checked my bank account and there was 8 charges with immediate reversals. So I went in and had to wait  in line and pay after telling them my order number. The next issue was when I had an order in my cart with a $3 coupon. Everything went through and it told me to check in when I got there. Got there and put in my curbside spot number and went to confirm payment. Now the promo coupon from the app won‚Äôt work and I have to remove it. Now today I went there after submitting my order.  Pulled into the spot put the number in and hit the confirm payment button. Now error message pops up and tells me that I have to go inside and tell them my order number to pay. Once again there is a charge and immediate reversal on my bank account. Another thing that I don‚Äôt like is that you can‚Äôt delete an order if you decide you don‚Äôt want to order food. You have to delete each item individually."
"This is a great example of terrible app design, it honestly should be used as a case study for CS students. 1. Load times are atrocious, even on wifi. It shouldn‚Äôt take 5-10 seconds just to load the splash screen and menu on wifi or LTE. 2. It takes over 10 clicks just to REORDER an item. 3. Reordering picks the closest store regardless of which store you ordered from previously. I always pick up from the same store, and its not the closest store, so stop making me have to re-pick my store every single time. 4. If you take more than 5 minutes to reach your pickup destination it cancels your order and makes you go through the process again. WHY!? The whole point is I want to order, arrive, give number at curbside. NOPE! 5. It doesn‚Äôt actually PLACE your order when you order. In fact, theres zero reason to pre-order with the app at all, since you end up waiting longer for curbside than the drive thru would take. 

UPDATE: The reward tiers also make no sense based on the value of the items in them. Its hardly even worth using, and not at all worth the headache. Bad experience, I‚Äôll stick with the drive thru. Not sure a company this large gets mobile ordering so wrong."
"I only tried to use the app one time to put a big order in and realized right away that it had several major flaws making it absolutely useless. Flaw one: it has a very limited order size. I have a large family, multiple teens, and usually their friends to feed. I usually cook from scratch, but was trying to place an order for a birthday party and it limited me to 15 items TOTAL. Second flaw: you can‚Äôt place a second or more consecutive orders to make up for the order size limit. It would‚Äôve taken multiple phones to accomplish this, which leads me to the third, and biggest flaw of all: you have to be gps verified in the McDonald‚Äôs you are ordering from to ‚Äúplace‚Äù the order. Now, this was big for us because I stayed home with the kids and sent my husband to pick up the food after I made the order, only to discover once he got there that it was a huge waste of time, and he could either reorder the whole thing, or cut our losses and get pizzas. The whole point of trying the app was to make this simple and time saving, right? To achieve that, we got Little Caesar‚Äôs pizza instead at this point. McDonald‚Äôs has a counter, a drive through, and kiosks in the store to make ordering more convenient. The app is absolutely useless."
"Works as advertised sometimes and is totally useless at other times. Today I placed a mobile order and get to McDonalds give them my mobile order number at the drive up and proceed to cashier who waves me up to second window only to be told they don‚Äôt have the order in the system. I give them the order verbally again and told to park and they will bring it out. 19 mins later I received my food. This has happened more than once and I‚Äôm a pretty patient person. 19 minutes is Unacceptable. Then I try to send them feedback comments on my IOS mobile device in hoping to improve the user experience and the app freezes up after completing 2/3 of the required info. I tried 3 times and it froze up each time after I selected the time and am/pm. Now I get home and download the MCD app onto my IPad. I get the same results when trying to send feedback, it freezes up each and every time I try to fill out the required info. Very frustrating and disappointed."
"I have tried using the app on at least 4 separate occasions to help with wait and efficiency or ordering at my local
McDonalds.  However, it has not done either of those things anytime I‚Äôve tried to use it.  The first attempt took more than 10 minutes to receive my order, several cars entering the drive-thru after me received their food and moved on before I received my order.  Second attempt, they prepared my order incorrectly.  The third attempt I was given the wrong order.  The fourth attempt, I tried to complete my order and received an payment error message, tried again & revived the same thing; then the app re-set to the home screen & there was nothing showing in my recent orders.  Checked my account there were 2 pending charges for my order; so I went inside to address the issue.  They tell me they had not received my order and that I will need to order at the register, which I do.  As I‚Äôm filling my drink, the manager comes over with 2 printed receipts asking if they were my order which I confirmed were.  Next I‚Äôm told I will have to complete 3 steps to attempt to get my charges reversed; first one being that I go out of my way to my bank to correct their mistake."
"I was interested in trying the ‚ÄúMobile Order & Pay‚Äù on a Saturday morning for my family of six thinking perhaps they would finally get my order right.  Well, I guess we‚Äôre stuck with sitting in the drive-thru for twelve minutes as usual; then getting home and discovering they got the order wrong AGAIN.  We‚Äôre stuck because we‚Äôre not able to order the same things from the app as we can in the drive-thru.  I can‚Äôt find the large Orange Juice option anywhere on the app.  I can‚Äôt find the two-Burritos Value Meal anywhere on the app.  I must be running an old version of the app, right?  Because McDonalds would never create an app that falls short, right?  Or is the crumby app reflecting the same experience you get in the drive-thru with incomplete orders. 

As I was typing this, my wife returned from the McDonalds drive-thru.  I know it may be difficult to believe, but they blew the order again.  MISSING A BREAKFAST SANDWICH!  Now I have one very disappointed child at the table.  Is this how McDonalds keeps their profits up; by shorting the customer?  Is this theft?  I feel like McDonalds is robbing me every time; not just robbing me of my money, but of the precious time I have with my children.  Thanks for nothing!  I‚Äôm done with you."
"This app was great , but now McDonald‚Äôs is loosing money on my business because, the app now has very few good coupons, and when it does have one I can use its mobile app anyway which we don‚Äôt like to use as it is but we did try , we can‚Äôt get monkey pay to even work , mine tells me that my local Macdonalds is closed and won‚Äôt even let me order from them .... I don‚Äôt understand all this tech that takes the face to face with the employees..... I don‚Äôt understand why you want to take the personal touch away , you have very little contact with your customer this way , as it is the employees at the Hudsonville site are already rarely friendly with customers, when they do see them , what is wrong with good old fashioned ‚Äú Hello, welcome to McDonald‚Äôs, may I take your order please ‚Äú and the thank you for coming and the please come agains , they don‚Äôt even fold the bag over anymore to keep the heat from escaping from the food on the bag oh my word that was such a huge no no when I worked there when I was a kid , anyway I go to Arby‚Äôs and Burger King a lot because they are always putting out good coupon and they are not afraid to welcome their customers and I have kids to feed so family coupons are often a must to afford to take them out"
"The pros about the app are that you can use Apple Pay, that it has rewards (both points and deals), and you can customize your order and see the prices easily. The major con that drives me nuts every time is that they don‚Äôt start making your order until you arrive. Which means that you have to sit in the parking lot for 5 to 10 minutes waiting for your order. If you‚Äôre driving the food to someone‚Äôs house 10 or 15 minutes away, having it ‚Äúhot and fresh‚Äù doesn‚Äôt make any difference. There‚Äôs no option to have them make the food when you order and bring it out to your car when you arrive. So basically using the app means that this will be the absolute slowest option, slower than going to the drive-through. You will sit in the mobile order curbside pick up and wait while you watch cars that came after you leave far before you. There needs to be an option to have the food made when you order, and you just agreed that it may not be fresh."
"I‚Äôve used this app and pretty much enjoyed the convenience of it but it has now developed a glitch that signs me out randomly and asks me to agree to the ‚Äúnew terms‚Äù. I‚Äôve had to agree to these new terms 4 times today. Example: I had to agree to the new terms this morning then I made an order prior to a trip to the restaurant but when I go there the App had signed me out and did not have my order stored. I had to reorder after agreeing to the terms two more times while sitting in the parking lot outside of the restaurant trying to use the App to order. I opened it later today and again asked to agree to new terms. Fix please!

Update- 
My frustration continues. I ordered with the app and arrived at curbside and was then informed there is no curbside nor in store pickup (even though the store had plenty of people in it). I did not want to go through the drive thru which had two lines full of cars and is notorious slow. Here‚Äôs the request - inform users of the pick up options available when the store is chosen, not after I have arrived."
"I have used this app heavily the past few months and have eaten at McDonalds far more than I normally would have. I did so due to convenience and my perceived safety with drive through only during the COVID pandemic. I just placed an order on the app with my total $5.90 w/tax.  Immediately afterward, I happened to pop on to my Discover account to check on to my next payment due date.  I saw a pending charge of $8.01 so I checked the recent order still showing on my McD‚Äôs app and sure enough, it still showed $5.90.  Moments later my email had a receipt for $8.01. A promo selected in my app now was removed.  

I have been frustrated on a business expense level that one cannot go back into the app to see past purchases. Receipts via email are hit and miss. Now to see McDonalds processes higher payments than showing through the app is the final straw. I have no way to know how often this overcharging occurs.  

 My wife and I have often discussed why do we go to McD‚Äôs?  The food generally is inferior to Wendy‚Äôs, Burger King, Hardee‚Äôs/ Carl Junior. I know I have been using McD as the app felt more polished and for convenience.  Now all I hear in my head is the guy from Shark Tank :  McDonald‚Äôs ‚Äúyou are dead to me‚Äù"
"I find the app too busy and confusing. The stores don‚Äôt seem to know how to incorporate the extra orders in a timely manner. It is literally a waste of time to order ahead! I tried it a few times, at several locations. Ordered ahead thinking my food would be ready when I got there. Not the case one single time. One store had to give me credit, because they were out of an item. The first person I asked for the credit said they couldn‚Äôt do it. Had to get a manager, and still had to wait 10 minutes for my order. 
The next store took me 15 minutes after I arrived to receive my order. It seemed as if they hadn‚Äôt even noticed there was an order through the app. 
This last one is what decided it for me. I chose the ‚Äúdrive through‚Äù option to pick up my order. Window one told me I had to park to the side and they‚Äôll bring it out. She acted as if waiting at the window wasn‚Äôt an option. Well, being hard headed I insisted on going to window two. Got told again to pull to a pick up spot and they‚Äôll bring it out. 
If I was willing to park to the side, I would NOT have chosen drive through option! 
Probably won‚Äôt even go to any McDonald‚Äôs for a while."
"I‚Äôve had this app on and off the past year or two on a different phone and I‚Äôd always have problems with even logging in when I have probably 12 different accounts on this thing. When I‚Äôd even get into the app, deals wouldn‚Äôt work, it would log me out and give me the same run around log in issues I‚Äôve had and coupons would normally always give me errors. Sure it‚Äôs helped me skip the ordering process and given me a few savings but it never works when I really want it to. Just today I‚Äôve installed it on a new phone I‚Äôve had for a week and I‚Äôd attempted to use my google login, it worked when putting in my google email and password but after that it would bring me to a screen to input my last name and to register when I was just logging in? Even after ‚Äúregistering‚Äù isn‚Äôt still took me back to the main login screen telling me the info has already been registered???? Deals can be okay but most of it is things like ‚Äúget a $1 of fries‚Äù or ‚Äúget a free medium drink with the purchase of a main menu item‚Äù"
"I love the idea of ordering ahead and not waiting in drive thru forever, BUT this app has only worked correctly maybe 2 times out of the 10 times I‚Äôve tried it. Some of the common errors I‚Äôve gotten: ‚ÄúMenu item not available at your selected location‚Äù .... yes, my location serves double cheeseburgers, but sometimes the app doesn‚Äôt think so. ‚ÄúLocation closed‚Äù .... no, my local McDonald‚Äôs isn‚Äôt closed at 2 in the afternoon, but I can‚Äôt order on the app. ‚ÄúCard not saved‚Äù ... after I‚Äôve entered the card information (correctly) for the billionth time. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre having trouble processing your payment‚Äù .... and then the whole app freezes and I have to do a hard reboot to get out of it. Right now, I can‚Äôt use it at all because it won‚Äôt accept any form of payment I‚Äôve tried (and yes, there‚Äôs money in the bank account tied to the card I‚Äôm trying to enter). In short, great idea, love the coupons. Bad execution. üëéüèº"
"Before downloading the app, I visited McD‚Äôs typically twice a week.  After downloading and having deals to chose from each day, I was visiting 5 times a week, sometimes more!  But with the last update, no decent deals available; no more free fries, no more buy a Big Mac get one for a discount, no more good deals!!!!!!  I don‚Äôt understand this!  Why would u not want to reward customers who make your life more easy by not having to use labor dollars for a cashier to take orders, not having to miss sales because some customer waits till they pull up to speaker to figure out what they want which makes your line back up and other people on the road pass u by because the line is backed up because of that one customer, why in the world would u want to alienate customers who make your business more profitable????  All the pizza places give the best deals to their customers who order online because it saves them in labor by not having to pay for more people standing beside phone!  Why would u allow people to get deals only to take them away?  I can easily give my business to someone else because you have turned me away with your recent update that only has useless and non-attractive offers!"
"Very easy to navigate, simple instructions. User- friendly and even recommended to a friend. Until the other day when I attempted to use but it won‚Äôt let me proceed until I agree to allow the app to continue tracking my data. 

The display of options 1. ‚ÄúAsk app not to track‚Äù or 2. ‚ÄúAllow‚Äù (which is pre-selected) is a SCREENSHOT so it APPEARS that you have a choice to decline but you don‚Äôt. You‚Äôre basically bullied into allowing them to track your data by pressing Continue (which is the only functioning option on the screen because HEY it must be a glitch so let me just press continue right?). That‚Äôs deceiving and I‚Äôd have more respect if they flat out said ‚Äúyou may proceed to use our app once you agree to data-tracking‚Äù. But the fact that it‚Äôs being forced and tricking you into thinking you had the option is such a low move. If both options actually worked I wouldn‚Äôt have an issue, but the deceit disgusts me. And yes I did give the benefit of the doubt and closed the app, restarted my phone, even tried again days later‚Ä¶ same thing.

I for one will not be deluded so I‚Äôve deleted and do not recommend this app."
"I‚Äôve already encountered two instances where I ordered a small caramel mocha through the app at 2 different restaurants, and when I get there to pick up my order I am told that their machine is broken or they don‚Äôt have item available, so I do not receive what I pay for. I‚Äôm then told that the store itself cannot refund me, and to do request the refund through the app. Then I get on the app and there is absolutely no ability to receive a refund or even submit a dispute for a refund. It just asks you to submit a request to contact customer service. Then customer service responds and tells you that the ‚Äúfeedback‚Äù has been forwarded to the appropriate store owners. I didn‚Äôt even submit feedback, I just wanted my money back. Your competitors have much easier systems in place for when these things happen. I‚Äôm very disappointed that I have to go through this much trouble just to get a couple of dollars back. At this point it‚Äôs not even about the money, because this has happened more then once and it‚Äôs unacceptable. The app and customer service have both been the same, terrible!!!"
"The app takes so long to enter in your order and then it forgets it sometimes after ‚Äúpaying‚Äù which can be stressful since it makes you you think you already got charged and thus need to waste more time wondering where it is and if you got charged. I just spent 20 minutes to get our order in for my husband to pick up only to find out that it isn‚Äôt saved in my account online but is only saved local my phone. Only my phone can check in to have the order started, not my account on my spouse‚Äôs phone. Also, if you accidentally log out on your phone your order gets deleted. When you log back in, the order is gone and not saved in the cart or in recents or favorites just deleted even after confirmation of receiving it. The deals are nice but with a big order it would be nice to have bigger savings. Since it takes so much time to use I only use the app maybe 20% of the time going to Mcdonald‚Äôs. I could have ordered, gotten my food and eaten it before the app order is processed."
"Ordered from the app, got to the restaurant drive thru to pick it up and was told it was declined so they wanted payment.  I explained that I already paid.  Showed them the Apple Pay receipt that said ‚ÄúApproved.‚Äù  Wouldn‚Äôt give me food. AMEX app showed ‚Äúpending‚Äù as all new charges do so I called AMEX.  They said it was approved and there was no reason it would be declined.  Franchisee still wouldn‚Äôt budge and said ‚Äúit‚Äôs not our app. - it‚Äôs ‚Äòcorporate‚Äôs‚Äô.  If you need a refund, call them.‚Äù  They handed me a coffee cup with the number for corporate and left me to find my own resolution.  

I tried McD‚Äôs corporate and after about 2 mins stuck in interminable robot menus I hung up and called AMEX back.  As before, they answered with my name and were extraordinarily quick and helpful.  We put a monitor on the charge and will dispute it in a week if it‚Äôs still there. Took a quarter of the time that I spent in robot menus with McDonald‚Äôs ‚Äúcorporate.‚Äù  If you want to experience great customer service, get an AMEX Platinum card. Just the extraordinary customer service is worth the annual fee.  If you want to be the customer getting batted around between a disinterested franchisee and a monolithic, impenetrable corporation, use this McDonald‚Äôs app."
"This is the worst app I‚Äôve used in my life. It tries to tell me there‚Äôs no Mcdonald‚Äôs near me when I live like 5 mins from one, never lets me see deals, & it constantly reloads itself/kicks me off of what I‚Äôm looking at. I‚Äôve never seen an app bug so much in my life. I‚Äôm deleting this app for good. I‚Äôm so frustrated w it at this point that it‚Äôs not worth it. No matter what I can‚Äôt get or even view any deals on the app. It doesn‚Äôt matter whether I‚Äôm on my data or WiFi. I even tried it with McDonald‚Äôs WiFi too & no matter what it tells me to check my internet connection whenever I try to look at the deals, yet every other part of the app will work & load for me (other then McDonald‚Äôs near me/ones I search that doesn‚Äôt lose either.) I can look at a menu, order, etc, but when I try to look at the deals it tells me ‚Äúno internet connection.‚Äù How can this be true considering I can do almost everything else on the app except look at deals and pick a location. Kinda bs if you ask me. Definitely not impressed. Was going to use/keep this app so I can order my order ahead of time, but if I can‚Äôt even view any deals or choose a location then I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth it. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
"By far McDonald‚Äôs has one of the easiest menu selections, and the best offers on deals within the app. The main problems are that there is no gift card option in the payment methods. And that after you place an order you again when you arrive at the restaurant have to interact with the app again to tell them that you are here. They leave options such as curbside pick up available, even encouraged. But that McDonald‚Äôs may not have enough employees staffed to do this, or it may be too late in the evening, and the app does not tell you and neither will anyone when you arrive. If you happen to arrive and there is no one present,Then you can‚Äôt click the I am already here button, until you were already at the restaurant and it apparently takes about a minute before the restaurant receives your order. In comparison both Burger King and Wendy‚Äôs do not have this issue and I can just arrive give them my order number and pick up my food right away without any interaction with the app after my initial order."
"Every time I use this app(and it‚Äôs pretty frequently), it always pulls up my order from the previous time it was used, like I had never completed the order. It always brings the check in screen back up when I open the app up. So I‚Äôll  close the app, and that usually doesn‚Äôt work, so I have to go through a whole thing where I have to reopen my bag just to delete the items from the previous order so I can continue with my new order. I‚Äôve even had to go so far as to deleting the app entirely and re downloading it cuz the app itself wouldn‚Äôt load at all, so I couldn‚Äôt use it. So whatever ‚Äúbug fixes‚Äù and ‚Äúupdates‚Äù that are happening to this app, either aren‚Äôt actually happening, or they‚Äôre just being lazy with the fixes because none of these ‚Äúupdates‚Äù I‚Äôve had have fixed any of the issues with this app. Once the coupon I use daily is over, If it doesn‚Äôt get a new expiration date like last time, I‚Äôll probably be done with this app. It‚Äôs not worth the frustration"
"I did have a really good 5 star review for this app. I‚Äôm changing it now though since it just completely stopped working and caused a pretty big problem trying to get food for my group. When I tried to pick up the order, it wouldn‚Äôt allow me to select a pickup option and said I had no connection. I restarted the app like it said. Same problem. Restarted the app and phone. Same problem. Deleted and reinstalled the app while connected to the McDonald‚Äôs WiFi at the location I was supposed to pick it up ‚Äúno connection restart the app‚Äù nonsense even though I just downloaded the app! I didn‚Äôt have money because it should have been paid for already and they didn‚Äôt have my order number inside. I went home and got my wallet and came back to try place the same order at the drive though when halfway through the order she already gave me my total which was more than what it showed on the app and told me to go to the window. Before I even finished ordering. I just left. I think that was my last trip to McDonald‚Äôs. The app is what kept me going there and if it‚Äôs not going to work then I‚Äôm not really interested anymore. Maybe I can get back in shape without McDonald‚Äôs in my life anymore lol"
"I guess I‚Äôm used to ordering food through apps and having it ready for pickup when I get there. However this app is nothing of that sort. You might as well stand in line or go through the drive through. I don‚Äôt see the purpose this App serves if you can‚Äôt order in advance and have someone else pick the order up for you. 

I placed an order for my daughter to pick up at the nearest McDonalds close to her job so she wouldn‚Äôt have to wait on me to bring food to her. She went to go and pick the order up and she was told that she can‚Äôt get the order without my phone because they have to verify the location. Mind you they had already given me a reservation number as well as a a receipt of payment sent to my email with a confirmation number and location on the receipt as well. They still told her that she could not get the order without my phone. What‚Äôs the point in ordering food to a location for pick and being told you can‚Äôt get it. Every other restaurant DOES NOT do this!!!!! If my card has been charged to whatever location, it shouldn‚Äôt matter who the hell I send to pick it up...especially if they have a receipt for pick up. Fix IT!!"
"I like the app. It‚Äôs user friendly but I would like it A LOT MORE if I could use more than one offer per purchase. Plus I think the app should have the ability to tell us that a particular item we‚Äôve chosen has a deal available. Like in Target‚Äôs app. Underneath the item I‚Äôve selected to purchase there‚Äôs a little tag symbol letting me know there‚Äôs a deal available. I think McDonald‚Äôs should do that so we don‚Äôt have to switch back and forth. Also we should be able to tip the employees that bring the food out to the cars through the app. Since there are times when it is freezing cold, rainy and/or snowy outside. Also if a mobile order was messed up or something was left out of the order we should be able to utilize the app and have someone bring it out to us instead of us having to go inside or through the drive through. That defeats the purpose of having the food brought out to us."
"Update from below - been at 3 weeks and the app is still broken with a cart that cant be cleared, making ordering impossible. Doesnt seem like they will fix this bug. Not worth the download.

Usually an okay app. However, you may want to fix the recent bug that has prevented ordering through the app. The cart doesnt allow resetting the cart. So all you can do is remove individual items. However recently it has locked expired coupons. So I‚Äôm unable to order anything because a coupon from several weeks ago is locked in my cart. I‚Äôve tried logging out and reinstalling the app, but neither does anything. I‚Äôm not sure why a store with a location- and time-specific menu would make it so difficult to clear the cart - but you may want to fix this.  And, it would make more sense if the cart also cleared after an order was completed. For some reason all of the items just stay in the cart, as if someone wants to keep reordering the same items by default. And you‚Äôve also made it next to impossible to give feedback about the app in the app - not an order in the app. So that seems poorly thought out."
"The app works, most of the time. Interface takes some getting used to, but after you learn it, it is pretty consistent - so not a big negative.
I have over 30,000 points and I wanted a milkshake the other day - just a small milkshake. So the points *can be* useless, because you can only choose what they give you - you can‚Äôt choose anything off the menu as rewards. Like if you want a milkshake on the wrong day.
Because I know you actually read the reviews, here‚Äôs some feedback:
I have had old orders be stuck in the phone and I couldn‚Äôt figure out how to get rid of it. I tried to delete all the items -that doesn‚Äôt work. Solution: bring the order ‚Äúback‚Äù and then choose delete (discard?) that order from the top in blue(something like that). The nice order taker at McDonald‚Äôs didn‚Äôt know how to do that either, even though she looks young and seems very savvy with phones. Getting that training to front line people like her, or even managers, will probably help some customers in the future."
"This is a horrible app. Whoever made it did not use their brain they were given at birth. You can‚Äôt order something and have your significant other or someone else, go pick it up while you‚Äôre busy even while having the exact same app on their phone logged in. In fact, the order doesn‚Äôt even show up on the exact same account that was ordered on on a different device. You have to drive into the parking lot with the phone you ordered on for them to even see your order or accept payment for it. They couldn‚Äôt even tell me if I could cancel it which thank goodness for my brain, I used it on the newly downloaded app and pushed cancel. They should know to tell me yes there is a cancel button not tel me I‚Äôm out $42 until tomorrow while trying to get a last minute dinner in on a crazy night and trying to make me wait until tomorrow to speak to a manager for a refund meanwhile having to double what I paid. All of this and the fact that the order is NEVER right no matter which location you visit is why we never go and won‚Äôt anymore. A waste of our evening. Do your app like chik-fil-a, you need some structure and brains on the team."
"App has good deals. A few rare ones turn out to be gold, that is until you get to the pay window after waiting 10+ mins and realize the coupon you were viewing at home (any burger for 1$ besides double quarter and artisan) is no longer viewable at the restaurant. Now I realize McDonald‚Äôs advertises fools gold. I would of left the restaurant feeling like an idiot but I open the Wendy‚Äôs app and i see Advertised, Dave‚Äôs single with any Purchase. Now I get a better burger and better ice cream at a better price. This happened once before when you introduced mobile pay and chalked it up to growing pains. Needless to say your app was deleted but I leave you with 3 stars and a thank you for turning me on to a far more trustworthy app. Edit: After looking through other reviews I realize my coupon changed to a McDouble for a dollar and that others are having this issue as well. Edit 2: After a quick and painless talk with McDonald‚Äôs app Customer service I am pleased with there response. I am now willing to give this app another chance, pls don‚Äôt leave me feeling like a fool again lol. Thank you."
"The feature that tracks McCafe purchases for the buy 5, get 1 free deal no longer works. I‚Äôve purchased several McCafe beverages recently that aren‚Äôt being tracked. I know those purchases qualify for this offer because they weren‚Äôt discounted or purchased as part of a separate offer. 

Other than this the app works fine most of the time as long as I pick up my food in the curbside parking spots. For some reason, if I go through the drive-thru the food never gets cleared from my shopping cart so it‚Äôs still there next time I use the app. Also, the drive-thru staff constantly asks me to pay for my mobile orders and some of them are highly confused when I tell them I paid in the app. 

As for improvements, there needs to be a way to add notes for the staff- like asking them to make sure they bring you ketchup, or napkins, which they sadly don‚Äôt always do without being asked. There also isn‚Äôt enough customization on some of the sandwiches. I‚Äôve seen some where it‚Äôs impossible to add a free condiment like mayonnaise, even though an employee can add that customization if you order through one of them."
"I used to use the app because it takes 30 minutes to get through the drive thru at my local McDonald‚Äôs (my husband spent 45 minutes between ordering and paying a few days ago and our food was cold when we received it) and if on lunch that‚Äôs half of my lunch. They closed to remodel so I hadn‚Äôt used the app in a while. After they reopened I tried using the app. I get daily reminders of deals to use via my notifications but even and uninstalling and reinstalling 4 times I can‚Äôt login. If I can‚Äôt log in how do I get notifications? Not only is the app losing a user, McDonald‚Äôs is losing a customer because I refuse to shove food down my throat because all of your locations take SO long using the drive thru and the app doesn‚Äôt work to do the curbside pick up. I have been using this app since the very beginning and have never had trouble like this. It looks like I‚Äôm not the only one, so my suggestion is fire the app team because I know you are paying them too much for an app that doesn‚Äôt work and hire some people who actually know how to create and work on apps. Sorry fries and sweet tea you will no longer be consumed in my household."
"I would give this app five stars except for a recurring error that after I have picked up a mobile order, the order persists in the shopping cart for days and it‚Äôs not easy to delete.
For some reason, even days after ordered, picked up the order, and moved on with life, the old order persists in the cart and the app asks me if I want to ‚Äúre-open‚Äú the order.  That question is meaningless because I  cannot order or use the app until I ‚Äúreopen‚Äù the old order or delete and reinstall the app. Recent updates now let you eliminate the old order by deleting each item one by one in the old order.  
What would be really useful is ifThe app checked and deleted orders that have been pending for a long time (e.g.more than a week or .there was some option other than re-opening the order, e.g., ‚Äúdelete old order‚Äù.
That said, the McDonald‚Äôs app is still far superior to its competitors‚Äô apps, which I don‚Äôt even try to use anymore."
"I‚Äôve used the app in the past to order in the drive thru, or at the counter in various locations...sometimes it‚Äôs easier to use than at other times (perhaps due to location), however, the other day while at home I attempted to use the mobile order and pay gesture for the first time...it went smoothly until I was informed that my iPhone (from which I placed the order) needed to be at the facility to complete the order (understandable, but not explained in the app)...(I had thought that I could place and pay for the order and have it picked u)...I cancelled the order and thought that that was done with...Unfortunately, it wasn‚Äôt done with...I received a (via email) receipt from a McDonald‚Äôs in Texas for an order that was completed at 10:44 p.m. that same evening...the issue is that neither I, nor my iPhone were in Texas...I was in eastern Iowa...can you explain that?   If I couldn‚Äôt complete an order in the town that I live in, how could someone in Texas complete a purchase and charge my account!?!  Not acceptable!  Aside from charging my account, I‚Äôve had to cancel my card(s) that were associated with the mode of payment...major inconvenience..."
"Hire some good developers from USA, pay them properly and ask to recreate this app from scratch and make it the best app compare any food chain in USA. 
What a nonsense App this is .. each versions adding more bugs rather than fixing things . I am using 5.13 ( latest version ) now , I went to a MacD and placed a mobile order, choose drive through , it display ‚Äútell to speaker‚Äù , I mention the order number displayed there , she told me she did not received any such order number.. wow.. earlier version at least used to give option for payment on choosing drive through and the order sequence number , this version that also gone . 
Biggest things not a single MacD  understand mobile ordering , specially if you are in city Atlanta ,GA. Stop this App and let it back to web based menu list or follow some companies mobile app like Walmart, Subway, Dunkin Donuts .. you will learn how to develop mobile software ."
"So I gave this app a 1 because I couldn‚Äôt figure out how to give it a 0. I tried to use the app once before and it did not take the coupons because it wasn‚Äôt supported in my area. Okay , no problem so I get there and my stuff takes at least 20 minutes to cook . I had a 2 for 4 and a smoothie. After I got my smoothie it was a small when i paid for a large . The manager was annoyed at having to make it again after I showed my receipt . I was very unhappy with the service. So a couple weeks ago I decide to give McDonald‚Äôs app a chance again. I felt that maybe the workers could have had a bad day and I mean it is always busy in the morning . So I order my food again and when I arrive , they tell me it never went through . I say that they charged me for it . They insist that I order through the kiosk or at the register and I say ‚Äú I‚Äôm in a hurry , that‚Äôs why I used the app‚Äù and the cashier reply was ‚Äú so are other people‚Äù .I won‚Äôt hold the sass against her because sometimes when I am frustrated I did tend to get sassy. So I said I was sorry and don‚Äôt mean to be rude but this is the second time I‚Äôve tried the app and it has not worked and no one has been fixing this issues ."
"Last year I loved this app and ordered from it all the time. Then all of a sudden the app started ordering things for me in the middle of the night. One morning I woke up and my McDonald‚Äôs order was already ordered and paid for. So I drove to my local McDonald‚Äôs and the employee said I placed my order at 3 am, while I was sleeping. Thought it was odd, but continued on about my day. A couple days later it happens again. Ignore it and cancel the order. But this happened for months. My McDonald‚Äôs app would order food on it own and would charge my card, so I would have no choice but to pick up the food the app ordered for me (which was the same meal over and over again). This crazy order saga stopped about a month ago. Now every time I try to use the app it won‚Äôt let me sign in any where. I‚Äôve tried deleting the app and restarting it. Nothing. Won‚Äôt even let me make a new account (it says my email is already being used). But it won‚Äôt even let me login and says that my email is already being used. So sad to say I will never be using this app again. It‚Äôs absolutely horrible!"
"I used to use the app all the time and it would work great and was one of my favorites. As of the last several months, it never works anymore and I encounter a new problem after finally fixing the last issue. It constantly logs me out of the app and won‚Äôt allow me to log back in via Facebook but when trying to log in via my email address, tells me I must log in using Facebook. It just keeps loading and after 10 minutes times out. I eventually made a new account with a different email so I could finally use the app again after months and it was working just fine until it then wouldn‚Äôt allow me to add my credit card for payment. Every time I put my info in it loads, then says ‚Äúcard not added‚Äù. So now I‚Äôm unable to put an order through rendering mobile ordering on the app completely useless. I know of others who have had the exact same issues at times also. Some days for some people it works fine, others it won‚Äôt allow you to do anything. So until these glitches get figured out, the app is useless and not worth having it take up space on my phone."
"The two main issues with this app - the gps tracking and the employees. 9 out of 10 times when I use a food ordering app it is to order and have someone else pick it up that is not myself. This is near impossible due to the app tracking you and if you try to check-in an alert will pop up saying that it ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt look like I‚Äôm here‚Äù. However that if you‚Äôre ‚Äúhaving issues‚Äù you can find a crew member and mention your order number. 

This is all fine and dandy however I tried to work around the ‚Äúsystem‚Äù and have my boyfriend still pick up HIS dinner. However the employee at the drive through continued to argue with him and state they had no mobile orders and refused to take the order number and was of no help. My boyfriend tried to explain what was in the order and the employee told him to drive up and pay for the meal which I was already made to pay through the app. 

This leaves my boyfriend hungry, me frustrated, and the employee, well I don‚Äôt know one customer less because there was no point in my boyfriend ordering more food through them for the rest of the night."
"A feature of this app is that it has the user check in to a McDonald‚Äôs when they arrive using the phone they used to make the order. This is problematic for anyone who is placing the order for someone else to pick up. I tried to place an order to have someone pick it up when they got off of work, to avoid them having to take the time to place the order themselves while they were still at work. Unfortunately, after I placed the order, I realized that I was not able to ‚Äúcheck in‚Äù from my phone, nor was the person picking up the food able to log into my account and ‚Äúcheck in‚Äù from their phone. I had already placed and paid for the order, and staff told the person picking up the food that the phone that placed the order had to be on the premises. The goal had been to save time with placing an order, and it ended up taking far longer than it should have, with us not even being able to get our order in the end. 

In addition, after the user places an order, the app says that they will not begin making the order until the user arrives at the McDonald‚Äôs location. So saving time by ordering ahead? Not an option."
"I have had completed orders hanging up in my app three times in the past two weeks. This issue seems to have started after the last app update. The o my way to get it to clear is to uninstall and reinstall the app. Also, when this happens I don‚Äôt get credit for my Macchiatos. There have been other times when the order does close and the count on the McCafe drinks doesn‚Äôt increase. I should have already earned three and I have only earned one. Both these issues are extremely frustrating. Please pass this info on to your app developers so it can be resolved in the near future. 
Aside from the issues I‚Äôve already mentioned, the app is easy to use and offers a lot of good deals. 
I have also had an issue w/a McDonalds employee insisting I needed to pay for my order, even though it was charged to my card. Of course I realize that is not related to the app and the manager reimbursed me for the double charge. I realize the drive thru gets very busy at times and mistakes happen. It would be worthwhile to retrain all employees on how to properly check out orders placed thru the mobile app. 
Thank you in advance for your attention to these issues."
"Overall it is a simple, easy to use app. But frequently after I have gotten my whole families order, and have gotten to McDonald‚Äôs, it will tell me that those items ordered aren‚Äôt available and are being removed from the bag. That is BEYOND frustrating. Now, I have to figure the whole thing out again (it‚Äôs not always just a meal- a lot of times it‚Äôs a shareable) and I end up spending more money then I wanted to in the first place. I don‚Äôt know why this is a problem. I understand if they are out of a salad or cookies, but there is no reason they can‚Äôt ring up a cheeseburger bundle that is available on the app. Not that Mac Donald‚Äôs needs my business but I just don‚Äôt trust the app anymore and don‚Äôt really use it for full family purchases. I have a disability and this doesn‚Äôt work well for me. There needs to be better sync somewhere on software or some improvements. I need to trust that my order will be exactly what I want from when I leave my house to when I pull up (within reason)."
"First problem is that the app won‚Äôt send your order to the store until you actually arrive. That makes no sense because you might as well wait in the line at the drive through. Next, due to horrible managerial practices, there‚Äôs only one person devoted to app orders. Just ask. But the drive through has the entire inside crew moving them along. If you show up after the dining room is closed no one is going to tel you that they can‚Äôt bring food to you at curbside. How do I know that?  They left me there for 15 minutes while everyone on the drive through had already cycled through and were on their way eating their food. 

Next, the people at the store can‚Äôt refund tour money if there‚Äôs a problem with the app order. You have to file a complaint on their corporate website and wait for a regional manager to email you, and then argue with them for a while before they will agree to put you in touch with their accounting department. Then it‚Äôll take 30-60 days to refund your money. 

So, after careful consideration I‚Äôve decided this app is total crap and that I‚Äôll not go to McDonalds for a very very very long time."
"It is very convenient for me to make my order and have it ready when I get to the McDonald‚Äôs of my choice. I‚Äôm not holding up any lines trying to get my kids to decide what they want. I can grab and go when I‚Äôm rushing to work. And best of all the deals are fantastic and my orders are accurate! I can even use the coupons at the kiosk if decide to order there. 
My only complaints are that it doesn‚Äôt seem to clear properly when you use the drive thru. Some menu items are not available on the app. If I order something no longer available I don‚Äôt know until I pick up my order. If you order before breakfast ends but pick up after, the item is canceled on your order instead of honoring the time you ordered. And lately it‚Äôs having an issue with my card. It tells me to restart the app. So I‚Äôve logged out and back in. I‚Äôve deleted and reinstalled the app but still have the same issue. Hope this gets fixed soon because this is my favorite app in the mornings."
"This is my 2nd time using the app to make an order and both times was a absolutely terrible experience. Much worse than ordering in person. The app like Starbucks app should speed the service. I should be able to place my order and then have it ready. In both cases, the order did not get executed. So I paid twice the first time. I am way too busy to recoup a 5 dollar charge. The second time, the restaurant didnt get the order until 5 minutes after I was waiting in the restaurant. The app hung and then would say I wasnt close enough even when I was standing there. Finally the order goes through and I end up taking 10 more minutes than if I simply went to the drive through. It was HORRIBLE. I ended up getting to my daughters piano class late. We go to McDonalds on the way to class every single Sunday. I decided to use the app to redeem points and it was by far one of the worst experiences. Its 2022 - if McDonalds want to have an app that is like Starbucks and it just works and people are happy, hire a tech team that can execute. Do it seriously or dont have an app at all."
"By far best fast food app

Issues
1-Location step almost ignored... It‚Äôs a fundemantal step... Allows you to accidentally order at the last store four stores away
2-Pickup options like store location non issue until to late... You can walk a mile to the restaurant, hit here, then learn store closed drive-thru only
3-If you order a hot fudge sundae you shouldn‚Äôt be handed a sundae without hot fudge, ice cream or nuts after arriving... McDonald‚Äôs world best fries were ruined without the Talo, the only reason I stopped for years... The huge sodas are gone... K, health police might be right... But no nuts on a sundae ridiculous, if Mom‚Äôs gave their kids nuts earlier we would have our kids lives re-ordered for the tiny few
4-It‚Äôs false advertising to have a tripleCHEESEburger with two slices of cheese... That‚Äôs why there is a McDouble and a Double Cheeseburger
5-A CHEESEburger should be made with cheese not cheese food or cheese product... Why the food Nazis permit false fraudulent non cheese amazes
6-SIMPLIFY the menu... The made to order 1/4 pounder is the bomb... Gooey cheese, liquid juices instead of stale pre-cooked like warm
7-McDs coffee was always fresh... It always had the correct amount of sugar and cream... Now it‚Äôs either stale, short sugar or short cream 50% of orders
8-Bravo... Finally something to go with coffee... How stupid to give coffee away without an upscale option, now three"
"I have tried to use this app several times and have always had a lousy experience. The first 2 times I ordered before I left my house only to find out that they will not start building your order until the app knows you are in a waiting stall.  Then you watch car after car exit the drive through with their food while you wait. Then tonight the ultimate experience when I pulled into a parking spot in the McDonalds lot. I selected the I‚Äôm Here icon and the apps GPS said I don‚Äôt think your here. So I couldn‚Äôt proceed. I eventually put my mask on and walked in to order at the counter and cancelled the order I tried to make on this app.  The app should not be using gps to do this because when you report you are there, the next thing the app should do is ask for a stall number.

Update: after McDonalds response to this review I have decided to remove the app. They will not prepare food until you are in the parking lot AND this Crummy app acknowledges your presence or better put, might not acknowledge you when you are there.... so they will NOT prepare your food while you sit in their parking lot!"
"It‚Äôs a great app besides mobile ordering. I placed a mobile order for my 16 yr old so she could eat dinner. I ordered for my local McDs and left town... about 35 mins later, my child calls and says she is in parking spot 1 for mobile pick up. We do this all the time with another restaurant so she can eat while I‚Äôm away. So I clicked ‚Äúim here‚Äù thinking i could just tell the app which space She was in.  Nope. It doesn‚Äôt work like other mobile ordering apps for other restaurants. You have to have that phone in the McDs parking lot. I ordered 10 piece nuggets and that is it. Once I clicked ‚Äúim here‚Äù, my order got all jacked up, it was sent to the McDs i had just passed 30 miles away from her, and it had submitted for a fish sandwich, a drink, bacon Big Mac, slushee... not even the 10 piece we ordered. It charged my card for those items. I called customer service for help and she had no idea how to help me but said charge would probably fall off in 48 hours. Nope, it still charged my card. The  cancel items button was no where on the screen. I‚Äôm not sure what happened but I won‚Äôt be using mobile ordering again."
"The app itself is great. I got a meal for $7 only I didn‚Äôt get the meal I actually wanted. I ordered a strawberry banana smoothie and sugar cookies which is what I got. And then I got my free medium fries. But I also ordered (and I really wanted this the most because I‚Äôve been craving it) a salad with grilled chicken and cheese. So when I arrived, they gave me half my order, made me stand there for 15 mins letting me miss 2 of my buses and when I spoke up about it they told me ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt have any salad‚Äù and they knew this the whole time but watched me stand there and wait for my order. I was patient at first because they were slightly busy but it‚Äôs ridiculous that nobody could speak up and say this from the beginning. A compete waste of my time. I wanted slightly to be healthy but they made me order nuggets as a replacement. When ordering from the app and choosing the location, I think the managers who work there should check off anything that‚Äôs no longer in storage so us customers shouldn‚Äôt have to waste our time and my money. I wasted my money on something I didn‚Äôt want."
"Additional comment a few years later: I can no longer customize some sandwiches like I used to be able to do. Please bring that back, including customizing breakfast sandwiches and burritos. Thank you. 

I have had this app since nearly its inception. It started out well, then got worse with only having coupons for fries or coffee/frappes for the longest time, finally has gotten better with many varied and usable coupons, but now hit the ultimate low in which I can only use just one deal a day and I cannot use anymore than that unless it has been over 24 hours. This is just ridiculous. I leave for work at variable times each morning. I love my local McDonald‚Äôs and I am nearly a daily customer. I have other options on my commute to work, and might be visiting those places now. Please remove this silly new restriction, forcing me to wait 24 hours, and go back to how things were."
"Believe it or not McDonalds, you're losing a lot of business with this latest aap.  If you can't fix the problems with this aap, then at least revert it back to a version that worked!  The Dunkin Donut's aap (and I'm sure many others), have worked flawlessly with no such problems as this one.  And even when they did have a glitch, they put out a ""fix"" right away!
I'm having the same problem as others who say their credit card information isn't being saved by the app making it useless.  It's been quite a while since the developers have been saying they're ""looking into it"".  With all the efficiency, strategy and methods McDonalds incorporates into their restaurants, I'm at a loss at how this can even take place.  Because it's taken this long with still no solution, maybe it's time to go over the Development team's heads and speak to corporate management!"
"This was an excellent, reliable app.  I appreciated the deals - but especially the ability to submit an order with specific details (eg,#ketchups, BBQ sauce, etc) in advance without having to yell into a microphone.   

One day, completely out of left field, the application fails. I delete the old app, shut off my phone and restart, then reload the application. But to no avail! I keep getting the same failure message! I tried this at least five times on different days.  

I have a relatively new iPhone with plenty of available utilities space and excellent internet connection and so I don‚Äôt understand what the problem could be. I‚Äôm extremely disappointed.  I always thought of McDonald‚Äôs as a quality organization with the resources available to offer and support a reliable phone application.  The app‚Äôs ongoing failure unmistakably tells me that McDonalds just doesn‚Äôt care about its customer‚Äôs experience.  Consequently I refuse to patronize any McDonald‚Äôs establishments until this failure is corrected.  Unfortunately, from what I can see - I guess this means I will never return.  Oh well, Wendy‚Äôs is a more than acceptable substitute."
"I don‚Äôt get it...I‚Äôve been using this app from the get-go, and just when I think progress is being made, I get blindsided by another deficiency.  One step forward and three steps back.  I downloaded the latest version of this app in February and I can no longer customize my items.  For instance, if I click on a beverage, it defaults to a medium, so I can‚Äôt change the size to a large or can‚Äôt customize to request half sweet/ unsweet tea.  I visit McDonald‚Äôs on the daily and sometimes multiple times a day.  This is beyond disappointing and frustrating.  Another issue I encountered is that the app no longer gives you the option to add the item or the meal.  It simply adds the item for you and then you have to add the fries and drink separately.  One major benefit of using the app, is that I‚Äôm entering my order, so it minimizes the room for error.  My order is transmitted as I entered it.  If something is wrong, it‚Äôs highly likely that it was my error and not McDonald‚Äôs.

Please fix these issues!  The app has come a long way, but this has really discouraged me from using it or visiting McDonald‚Äôs."
"When this app works it‚Äôs really great. The deals are great too, and the UI is very straightforward. But there‚Äôs some odd glitches/features...
-After paying for and getting your food, the app continues to monitor your location. You‚Äôll drive an hour away, look at your phone, and for some unknown reason the app is still using your location. You have to force quit to make it stop.
-When you next use the app, even if weeks later, it retains your last order as if it was never completed. You have to go and delete the items in order to use new deals, or to avoid some message about how breakfast is over (even though you don‚Äôt want breakfast, it‚Äôs just retained that breakfast order from a month ago)
-The app doesn‚Äôt always register when you‚Äôre at the location, even after clicking that you‚Äôre there. This may partially be due to employee training, but after years you‚Äôd really think that this was something that McDonald‚Äôs could get down
-It always assumes you want the closest McDonald‚Äôs, which may work the majority of the time... but if you‚Äôre traveling in a different direction (e.g., to work in the morning on the same route you take everyday) you have to manually change location every single time. Would be nice to set default restaurant
-Not so much the app but instead probably McDonald‚Äôs, but it‚Äôs a bummer you can‚Äôt use multiple deals... especially your McCaf√© reward with another discount."
"I tried this app in the past, but the glitches never allowed the order to go through. It‚Äôs been awhile, so I decided to try again. My order went through okay, but took forever to get (I picked my order up inside). Turns out they had my order ready, but never called the number, so it was just sitting around. When I got home, I was missing a sandwich and fry. I called the store and they asked me if I would like to come pick it up. No thank you, it‚Äôs 15-20 minutes one way and just not with it, would they please refund those items. I was told they can‚Äôt because I used the mobile app. They said I had to call the corporate number on the app for a refund. I called. It took 20 minutes to fill out the necessary paperwork, which only sent a refund request to the owner of the store, I still have to wait for someone to contact me about getting my money back. 

This will be the last time I use the app. I had hoped it would make my stop more efficient, but I have eaten up about a half hour between talking to the store and corporate, and I still don‚Äôt have my money. I am extremely frustrated with the whole experience."
"I‚Äôm amazingly optimistic. So I rarely do negative feedback reviews. So I‚Äôm not excited about it. I‚Äôve had the app for about a year straight. I love McDonald‚Äôs and so does my family, but the app is not there when it‚Äôs needed most. 8/10 times I‚Äôm ready to use the app or use a coupon at the window, it fails out for whatever reason. Stays continually loading, repetitively logs you out and just flat out closing the app. Sometimes we‚Äôre not always able to mobile order or dine in, so keeping the line held up for 5 minutes while I figure the App out is something I‚Äôm not comfortable with. The coupons bring me to the restaurant, but I hardly get to even use them. I‚Äôve kept it for a year or so BECAUSE I am amazingly optimistic. So I gave it a fair try. I‚Äôve found that the app makes me a bit more frustrated then just not having the app. Knowing there is Coupons and Deals but no way to get to them most of the time, just is a Bummer. So my solution until improvement is ‚ÄúOut of site, Out of mind.‚Äù If I don‚Äôt see the deals then at least I can‚Äôt be mad if I don‚Äôt get them. 

Sincerely, 
Worlds Most Optimistic Guy"
"I enjoy using the app to order, but as another person noticed lately it is leaving my prior order in the cart instead of actually clearing it And there doesn‚Äôt seem to be a way to take a deal out. It will let me delete the food from my cart but Not the deal, so when I tried to add another deal it says there‚Äôs already one in my cart and I can‚Äôt use more than one. Even though the existing one is unavailable since I‚Äôve already redeemed it. It‚Äôs just sitting there blocking my cart from being used for anything else and it‚Äôs completely annoying. The only other thing I would add is that drive-through staff severely need some training on how to treat app orders. Invariably they tried to hand me the food for the person behind me because they don‚Äôt apparently have a way of placing the app orders in Queue sequence With the orders being manually entered at the speaker. Depending on the location sometimes they even make me feel like a weird kind of zoo creature as if placing a mobile order is so rare and unusual that if it‚Äôs not ubereats they can‚Äôt fathom that I exist. So that‚Äôs kind of disconcerting as well."
"Overall I enjoy using the app but be aware that those that choose to add a credit card to auto pay - that in the event that an item or items that you order are not available AFTER you‚Äôve paid at the drive through, getting a refund if said McD‚Äôs is privately owned will be a nightmare! This has happened to me in the past when I ordered breakfast sandwiches that the app showed were available yet when I went to the window they said sorry we don‚Äôt have those or are not serving those at this time yet I had already paid for them! They told me I had to call the 800 number in the app to get a refund but again since it was a privately owned McD‚Äôs I had to contact the owner to get a refund. The rep on the phone supposedly sent my email address and name to said owner but I never heard from them meaning I ended up doing a charge back on my credit card and had to keep an eye out on my bank statement to make sure I was actually refunded = What a pain!
I never did hear from said owner."
"Initially I didn‚Äôt have any problems with using this app. I found it was user friendly and convenient. The only issue I found then was the limitations on rewards used per visit. Now over a year later, I‚Äôm experiencing problems with using the rewards. When I try to use the app during breakfast hours, only lunch or dinner items are accessible (which the restaurant isn‚Äôt going to honor). And during lunch or dinner hours, only breakfast items are available. However, when I tried to see if I could order the available reward, the app still didn‚Äôt permit me. So basically I‚Äôm only able to accrue points, but unable to use any of them. I also asked a manager for assistance and unfortunately they weren‚Äôt able to troubleshoot the problem. 

One other issue, is I also don‚Äôt understand why McDonald‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt permit you to use your receipt to add missing rewards. This is the only app that I have, where I cannot add my points later (in the event the app want scanned)."
"It use to be a good app I use for few years with no problems. Now it won‚Äôt allow me sign I already have a existing account but it keep saying at the top of screen there are some technical difficulties try again later or reset app. I use the same email address & password & won‚Äôt let me login this been happening this year when y‚Äôall had the J Balvin deal with BigMac, medium fries, & an Oreo cookies & cream McFlurry. I am very disappointed because I can‚Äôt even get the coupon deals on app any more like I use to before. I think it‚Äôs the updates the more the app being updated the more problems we run into. When I first use this app I sign in through google like always now it says google is canceled when I put email & password in. So please fix the login process I restart the app & even try to register again & change password it wouldn‚Äôt allow me to. Also now I don‚Äôt even see McDonald‚Äôs sending notifications of deals to email anymore. I‚Äôm just so disappointed because I liked this app in the beginning until it started messing up. I may just delete this app & be done with it."
"Mobile ordering has never worked for me. There‚Äôs always some sort of error and it usually involves the location not understanding how to handle mobile orders. The last time I tried was to get a deal on a coffee offered by the app. I made my mobile order and went to the correct location I chose. I selected drive thru because the location wasn‚Äôt open inside. When I pull up to the drive thru I get nothing. 24 hour McDonald‚Äôs and I‚Äôm being ignored at the drive thru.. I pull up to the first window and a girl is standing there and tries to pretend I‚Äôm not there. I have to wave for her attention, when I get her attention I explain that I made a mobile order, she looks puzzled and tells me to hold on. I proceeded to wait a whole 10 minutes for them to figure out my mobile order and how to process it. By the time I get my coffee and I‚Äôve spent almost 15 mins in the drive thru and to top it off they didn‚Äôt put the correct amount of cream and sugar that I requested in the app.. This has been my experience with mobile ordering every time I‚Äôve tried it through out the years and I keep making the mistake of trying it again.. IM DONE!"
"When this app was originally launched, it was absolutely AWFUL. There was this big push from the company to ‚Äúget our app, get our app‚Äù, but it really was more of a waste of time than it was anything productive or efficient. However, time has evolved and I have to say the team behind this has done an amazing job making the app much more user friendly, improved functionality, etc. The only area of improvement I have now is around the deals offered within the app. There needs to be more of a variety of deals available, as they tend to be a repetitive or very similar. In addition, I‚Äôve encountered several issues with being able to use these deals in the restaurant, even though an option is given to scan it at the restaurant - this is if the restaurant even accepts deals. They‚Äôre only ‚Äúvalid at participating restaurants‚Äù and I seem to find more restaurants that are not participating versus those that are participating."
"I like the app a lot now that it is running more smoothly than it had at first. There are two things I would change if I could. 
1. In the promotions tab on the ordering menu, make it more clear what the promotions are. Like right now there are breakfast sandwiches on 2/$4, but when you go into the promotion tab, it just shows the sandwiches. Nothing about needing to buy 2 or anything. 
2. This is totally just a personal thing for me but would allow me to use the app to order more often..... in the sodas you have ice or no ice as options. I usually order light ice. I know it seems kinda silly, but it‚Äôd be nice if I could get my stuff the way I want it without having to bother the staff to change the order when I arrive. 
Otherwise now that the bugs are mostly worked out and the staff know how to deal with mobile orders and coupons,‚ÄôI like the app and the deals it gives. Worth it, even if you only go to McDonald‚Äôs once in awhile, for the coupons."
"App works ok but is lacking features. Ordering and selecting Cash as payment should be one feature available for drive thru and inside pickup. (I understand curbside should be prepaid with credit card). 
Also customizing sandwiches needs more options. For example you Can‚Äôt change a plain roll to request an artisan roll. When you redeem a free beverage reward the choices should be categorized in some fashion. Right now I have to scroll through a huge list of drinks to find the one I want. Changing pickup location can be difficult. GPS location seems to be a problem. When I was sitting at a McDonald‚Äôs parking lot on New Britain CT it told me I was ordering at another McDonald‚Äôs 2 miles away instead of the one right in the parking lot I was at. 
 Removing an entire order from shopping cart tends to be difficult. Also viewing recent and pst orders on the app lacks much detail such as time, payment method used and prices paid for each item. 
It‚Äôs a good start and have seen some nice improvements but more can and should be done."
"The app needs some capabilities added. 
1) when placing a mobile order, there‚Äôs nowhere that I can add Mac sauce to the sandwich I‚Äôm ordering (unless it‚Äôs a Big Mac).  So I have to order at the store. 
2) The location finding map needs to be changed so that a person can locate the local McDonald‚Äôs based on the area presented in the map - such as, ‚Äúsearch area‚Äù after the user adjusts the view of the map as they want. Stop requiring ZIP Codes (nobody knows those without looking them up) and it‚Äôs so cumbersome to have to figure out the right spelling of a town, of which.... maybe I want a group of towns/cities as opposed to just 1 location. 
3) There‚Äôs so many app updates !! Stop it !  Redesign the app so any updates necessary get loaded ‚Äúbehind the scenes‚Äù, similar to how different ‚Äúlocal‚Äù menus get loaded in for different locations.  I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen an app get so many updates. Are the app designers really that inept that they can‚Äôt get the bugs out. Sure, I understand that a bug or two might creep in.... at the beginning of an apps design. But come on, you do it way too frequently."
"Every time I open the app, I get logged out. Then I have to consent multiple times to Terms and Conditions for every re-login. It‚Äôs annoying. I used the app to place a pickup order. While still on the app‚Äôs interface, the app logged me out when I pulled up to the drive-thru. I closed the app, reopened it, and nothing. I couldn‚Äôt get the passcode to pick up the order I had placed; I had to tell them my name. The stupid app started working when I was on the way home. It‚Äôs inconvenient, and I don‚Äôt know if the deals/rewards are worth it.

Edit:
So the app definitely improved from the initial review I made. The app no longer logs me out when I get to McDonald‚Äôs, so that is a definite improvement for me. I‚Äôm able to use my rewards, earn points, and order through the app without freaking out that my order not got placed. To the developers, you guys are doing a good job. Thanks for fixing the glitches."
"I would love to use this app because I have a five month old and waiting in line can be very stressful, even if it‚Äôs the drive through. But this weekend we waited for 15 minutes in the pickup location after completing our mobile order with not one word from an employee only to go inside and be told we haven‚Äôt paid so they aren‚Äôt going to give us our order. My husband showed them our credit card app (which works flawlessly), where the card had been charged, but they still made him pay again. He was told to come back after the charge posts to the credit card and they would refund him the amount. Yeah, we mobile order so we don‚Äôt have to go inside, but let me just run up there and have a 20 minute conversation with a manager to get my $4 back. Not likely and you know it. I also took the online survey about my experience, giving it a bad score, explaining why, and requesting communication back. Nothing.
There‚Äôs a problem between the app and the store and McDonalds is making twice the money until they fix it, so I‚Äôm sure their incentive is quite low. Pretty sure I‚Äôd never have to pay twice at Chick Fil-a."
"Honestly, I‚Äôve given this app multiple tries. Every time I order, I go pick up my food and the order number is no where to be found on the app. Sometimes my order completely disappears and an employee has to now verify on their end(which they always seem confused)before preparing my meal and most times I now have to stand on line and re-order. So so frustrating. My reasoning for ordering ahead is for the convenience of walking in, grabbing my food and walking out fast(since I‚Äôm often alone with my kids). This app needs a better tracking system. Order number should stay on screen until order is picked up. Or an email should be sent to confirm that order went through. I‚Äôve been charged double at times most times causing me to just walk out. It‚Äôs frustrating and such a long unnecessary process to pick up a fast food meal. Delete the app completely and just bring back more workers. I hate those kiosk, so dirty and take much longer to order than an actual person at the register."
"This is literally the worst fast food app I‚Äôve ever used and I‚Äôve used a lot. As I‚Äôm typing this I have that blue bar showing that McDonald‚Äôs is actively tracking my location for an order purchased AND received TWO DAYS AGO. Unacceptable and 100% illegal. I can‚Äôt count the number of times I‚Äôve ordered something, drive thru confirms it and then at the pick up window they‚Äôre saying I didn‚Äôt pay for something I paid for because it didn‚Äôt show up on their screen... even though it showed up for the drive thru person verifying the order. I tried resetting the app (and my phone) and I cannot get rid of that order in my cart that‚Äôs currently tracking my location. 

On top of that, it‚Äôs just a bad UI for an app. Home tab is a waste of space. Really, not a lot of time was put into this app for user experience and it shows glaringly. McDonalds needs to fire the developers and then sue them for building an app so poorly it tracks your location days later. I will be consulting an attorney to see if there‚Äôs anything else I should be doing regarding this illegal activity."
"My husband was driving home after having worked late. He asked me to use my app to place an order for him to pick up on his way home. I placed the order and when he drove into the parking lot I clicked on the ‚ÄúI'm here ‚Äú button and the message was ‚Äúhmmmm. looks like you‚Äôre not here!‚Äù I guess the app uses the location of the phone to know whether you are at the location. I got a message that said ‚Äúif you‚Äôre already here, please see a crew member and give them your order number.‚Äù  The manager said that they phone has to be at the restaurant to be able to submit the order and suggested that my husband go pick me up or get my phone. We had the order number which should have been sufficient. He even had a screenshot of the entire order and the manager still said that MY phone had to be at the store. My husband pulled up his Whataburger app, placed an order that was ready and waiting when he drove across the highway to the restaurant. 

The phone with the app should not have to be at the location in order to use it."
"With the recent Covid situation, I‚Äôve found myself to be using restaurant apps more frequently to order and pay remotely so as to reduce person-to-person contact.

So I‚Äôve been using several apps, and McDonald‚Äôs app usually runs pretty well. I have run into a couple of situations that the restaurant was not able to help me with.

First instance was when the restaurant was out of Coke. They asked if they could give me something else to drink, however there‚Äôs not really anything else I wanted so I requested if they could remove it from my bill. They were unable to do so so they gave me my food and I figured I would just have to pay for a Coke I didn‚Äôt get.

Second instance I believe is related to the first one. I ordered through the app and it showed I paid, however it did not show as paid in the system at the restaurant. So I gave them my card and paid in person. At that point I had not received an email receipt for the first instance, so I wonder if because that first hadn‚Äôt cleared the second wouldn‚Äôt.

Those normally wouldn‚Äôt be a problem, however around a month after those occurred, I got email receipts for both, the first having the Coke I didn‚Äôt get and the second being a double charge for what I paid for in person.

So as the title says, this is a good app, however it might require some in store training (which I understand McDonald‚Äôs employs a lot of people so that may not be realistic)."
"BEWARE! First and foremost this is one of the worst fast food apps out there. DO NOT PUT YOUR CC INFO IN THIS APP!!! First they have a security breach causing my cc info to be stolen and used across the country. Then they say that  it is a top priority to recover my money. Fast forward 2 weeks....no response. Thanks McDonald‚Äôs. Then another time shortly after, I do a ‚Äúdeal‚Äù buy a breakfast sandwich and receive a free McCaf√© beverage. Used Apple Pay,  accepted transaction, then the app says they have a problem on their end. App says the restaurant is closed when in fact it was open. Walked in and they charged my Apple Pay for the drink too! Then let‚Äôs talk about their under trained, half English speaking, idiot staff who can‚Äôt figure out how to refund or even cancel the order and give my money back forcing me to pay for everything. Great deal. Again thanks McDonald‚Äôs! And these morons think they deserve more money per hour! What a joke. They don‚Äôt even deserve minimum wage. The deals are terrible. The app is terrible. The customer Service for the app is terrible. Not what I would expect from a player as big as them. You want a good fast food app...goto Taco Bell."
"I would have given this app 4 stars because of an annoying bug. However, when I reported the bug I did not get a response for several days and when the response finally came it was only instructions on how to customize an order. This had absolutely NOTHING to do with the bug. So I am giving it 3 stars instead.
The bug that I reported was that when I order 2 2 value meals with different drinks, the app changes both of the drinks to be the same as the last one selected. I ordered a Big Mac meal with a Dr. Pepper. I then added a Big Mac meal with a Diet Dr. Pepper. When I looked at the cart, it showed 2 Big Mac meals with Diet Dr Peppers. I removed both and started over, this time with the diet drink first. This time it changed both to the regular Dr Pepper. So I tried to edit the cart and it would only let me change the drinks for both. Let me be clear, I did NOT change the quantity of the meals to 2 at any time. But the app kept changing it anyway."
"Three main issues I have to deal with. I second the daily deals/deals where the reset time is crazy. Make it 20 hours from use so your not for forced to wait for it to reset if you come prior the expiration time. 

The whole not allowing to order food that is actually available but in the app either side of time switch items aren‚Äôt available in the app. In the morning I cannot order breakfast items from 1010 am up to 1030. And then cannot use the app to order lunch items until at 1050 am. Why is this forced time out for ordering not closer to the actual time? What can‚Äôt the software be built to have this flexibility. If you get there after or before the change say 5 minutes prior should get an alert that your order will be forced to be changed to available items. Please fix this nightmare for users and the employees that have to deal with disgruntled customers. 

Last issue menu boards do not flip at change over time and stay stuck in back menu or something like that. And the. Sometimes the drive through line is forced to sit and wait and the employees get treated many times with hostility and I‚Äôm sure drive offs. I was going to drive off due to the above time lock issue the day prior. Almost getting to the point of taking my business elsewhere. 

Especially when wanting to enable contactless payment/ordering options. Your failing massively with these continuing issues."
This is the 2nd time in about a week that McDonalds charged my credit card twice for the same order. I placed a mail bike order and then had difficulty selecting the correct restaurant. I entered the location I wanted to use but it kept switching back to a different restaurant. Finally I was somehow able to tweak it so the order went to the correct restaurant but at the drive thru the staff worker told me my order was declined and that I would have to pay for it in person which I did; although there was no indication on the app that the payment was declined. Then we I got home I saw my credit card charged twice for the same order. And this has now happened in two separate occasions; this double dipping McDonalds is doing for the same order. I tried to contact McDonalds through the app but it looks like the contact page is so glitchy that it‚Äôs impossible to send a message (intentional I wonder?). So until they fix this problem be careful of using mobile pay and check your credit cards to make sure McDonalds isn‚Äôt ripping you out of your hard earned money by charging twice.
"I love the idea of order ahead on an app. I HATE that you have to have the phone with you to pick up your order. I also cannot do curbside pick up because thenpay feature no longer works. I have to do drive thru and embarrassingly get told my payment was declined and then pay with the exact same card that wasn't processed. Last time it charges and refunded my card 17 times!!!! My bank was even confused. Now my card had a fraudulent flag on it from this app. It won't process payments correctly and therefore won't send the order in as paid. It takes longer to order on the app than it does to just go through drive thru!!!! Very poor app maintenance and execution. It worked great for the first two orders and the coupons were good. Now it took away nearly all of my coupons and won't process a payment. I've deleted it and reloaded it, added different cards to pay from, contacted customer service , etc. they need a better app or no app. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è not much else to say. I'd rather just have paper coupons sent In The mail like Burger King does!"
"Not only does the app have your credit card information, after you‚Äôve been charged for your items, it shows in your account that it‚Äôs been debited from your account, then you‚Äôre locked out of your account you can‚Äôt retrieve or delete your information and if the workers decide that they don‚Äôt believe you paid and you have to log into the app and you have to log into your banking app proving that you paid then it just becomes so much easier to just go to the competition and take advantage of their wonderful deals!!!!

 at Sonic they have a happy hour where all their drinks are half-price.
So waiting at the competition for another 10 minutes is so much less stress than trying to get good service at McDonald‚Äôs where I paid and payed and paid all this money into the app to get rewards and now when I need something to eat I‚Äôm locked out of my own account and they have my credit card information so I want I want the whole app shut down for everybody because if I‚Äôm not allowed to use it then maybe nobody should get to use it"
I can use my account on other phones just not mine... I have an iPhone 6s. I called support multiple times and all they can say is they‚Äôll let me know when it‚Äôs fixed and a lot of iPhone users are getting the same critical error message as I am. I won‚Äôt go to McDonald‚Äôs unless I can use the curbside feature. I also take orders for groups of people with custom orders so it‚Äôs less stressful to just order through the app. I‚Äôm so disappointed that McDonald‚Äôs wants to tweak everything so often that it loses some of its loyal customers. I hope they just stop updating constantly work on the basic bugs of logging in and keep it the same so we can actually use it. I tried to order something they had advertised... a Big Mac bundle and the lady told me she couldn‚Äôt ring that up because it‚Äôs a mobile only deal. I told her my app doesn‚Äôt work and she wouldn‚Äôt make the exception. I have a feeling I‚Äôll never be able to use the app again because it‚Äôs been about a week now and it hasn‚Äôt changed a bit. McDonald‚Äôs hasn‚Äôt given me any updates either.
"First off, don‚Äôt try using this app on an iPad. Scaling properly is the least of your worries. The app requires you to create an account before you look at the menu for your area, which is annoying. You can create an account with an iPad but if you click on the link in an email you will be told to ‚Äúselect the activation link directly from your phone to complete your registration‚Äù so it‚Äôs not recognizing the iPad as a mobile device. Okay so I pulled out my iPhone to click the link and that worked but Safari couldn‚Äôt complete the request because I didn‚Äôt have the app installed on my phone. After installing the app on my phone I can‚Äôt log in. It says sorry that didn‚Äôt work, confirm your internet connection and try again or restart the app. Restarting the app did not help. I was going to give it 2 stars if it worked but between my two Apple devices I can‚Äôt even set up an account to use the app. Faster just to hit the drive-through and wait. Food still tastes great, but the app developers dropped the ball hard for such a big corporation like McDonalds."
"I‚Äôve used this app twice, 2nd time was to see and give a chance if it really works for me...unfortunately, it‚Äôs a waste of time...I placed my orders thru the mobile app, any store promo doesn‚Äôt apply and you can only use 1 coupon at a time...although you already paid for it by putting your credit card info, they still want you to check in when you‚Äôre at the store, and that‚Äôs when they start preparing your order instead of just picking it up once you arrived the location...worst part is if there‚Äôs no available customer service for mobile orders, you will have to wait longer...happened to me twice so what‚Äôs the point of ordering ahead if you ended up waiting still. Also, they ask you to check-in by putting the parking space number for mobile order pick up, nothing is always available because other customers are using the space for regular parking, so you end parking somewhere else, going in to the store to check in, instead of just waiting in your car to pick up your order. I‚Äôm sorry but this app doesn‚Äôt make sense when it comes to ordering ahead or faster service."
"I‚Äôm uninstalling this app it‚Äôs been giving serious issues. I order go and pick up and at the drive thru window they always tell me that the payment did it go through so I have to cancel the order and pay at the window. So I‚Äôm charged twice every time I use it. Normally the money goes back, BUT, Now finally they did the same thing and charged me twice and did not return the money and I have been in contact with the local offices and every time I call they give me the run around and refuse to reimburse me it‚Äôs a locally owned franchise it‚Äôs disgusting that McDonald‚Äôs let‚Äôs people use their name to steal like this from people. I‚Äôm assuming the manager and the employees at the store where this happened are 1) either cannot figure out how to use the app properly or 2) they‚Äôre running a scam to steal from people by charging them twice and claiming the charge didn‚Äôt go through when the bank clearly showed the charge they‚Äôre fighting for $15 the hour so they can steal from you, I‚Äôm also considering litigation for this theft because the refusal to reimburse me is a theft"
"I‚Äôm very happy with the functionality of this app -better than most fast food apps out there.  However, we wish there was an option for another person to pick up curbside. Often my husband would like to place the order through the app on his iPhone and pay for it, and then I would go to the restaurant to pick up the order. Unfortunately, we can‚Äôt do that at McDonalds because the person who placed the order is required to check in through their own mobile app when they arrive, note their particular parking space, and then pay. Unless I take his iPhone to the restaurant, I am unable to pick up his order. 
The ability to ‚Äúpay now‚Äù and to indicate that another person will pick up the curbside order would be a nice option to have for an assistant picking up an order for their boss, spouses picking up for each other, etc."
"This was a great app, but with the most recent update it won‚Äôt even launch and crashes before completely loading. It‚Äôs been like this for at least a week now and it‚Äôs very inconvenient to order at the drive through speaker when the entire menu is no longer displayed and you can‚Äôt get them to understand your customizations due to food allergies. Very, very frustrating. Please fix your app McDonald‚Äôs.

Update: The app is still broken after all this time. It is now November and I can get to the login screen, but I get the technical difficulties excuse. I‚Äôve tried redownloading the app, I‚Äôve upgraded my iOS at least twice now, and nothing makes it work. McDonald‚Äôs you had a great app, but it‚Äôs been useless for months now. I can‚Äôt get the employees to understand the changes I need made to my food, so it‚Äôs dangerous for me to eat there now. There‚Äôs been complaint after complaint letting you know the app is jacked up. This app can be fixed by a developer from their bed if they want. The pandemic is no excuse for this. Handle your business McDonald‚Äôs, this is pathetic."
"UPDATE: Contacted the mobile app line two days ago. Told me I had to go through my bank for a refund since it was a ‚Äúfraudulent charge‚Äù. Refused to refund no matter what I said to them. Contacted my bank and told them what the McPeople said and they LAUGHED. Said they‚Äôve never heard of a company not refunding a customer for an order/issue that wasn‚Äôt placed by them. So I have to fill out about 4 pages worth of fraud discrepancy forms. I find it RIDICULOUS that a company REFUSES to give money back to a customer for an order or issue that the customer has no control over or didn‚Äôt place. shows you how money grubbing they are that they won‚Äôt give me MY money because of an issue on their garbage app. But not to fret... Burger King here I come!

 Have had nothing but issues with the mobile order app. The two times we‚Äôve ordered on it when we go to pick our orders up at the store listed, they have no history of our order being placed with them. Now my wife got a notified that her order in NYC has been placed (we live in Kentucky üòë). Will be calling support and removing any and all info they have of ours."
"I apologize if this review isn‚Äôt so much about the app but McDonald‚Äôs Rewards & Deals as a whole. The app itself is fine. For the most part it works. On occasion I‚Äôll experience a hiccup or two. My biggest gripe is that I‚Äôm only able to redeem reward points or one deal per transaction. So if I wanted to order a meal, burger, fries and a drink, I can‚Äôt because the system won‚Äôt allow it? Let‚Äôs compare to the Chick-fil-A app. If I have enough points, I can order my entire family meals but McDonald‚Äôs limits me to one item per transaction? I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to those at the restaurant for me to create several different transactions because of McDonald‚Äôs stupid system. I typically stockpile my points but now I know I‚Äôll need to start using them more regularly. McDonald‚Äôs, if you take any of this feedback seriously, please change this. We shouldn‚Äôt be limited to redeeming points for one reward or deal per transaction. I can understand not stacking deals but you shouldn‚Äôt limit people to the reward points they‚Äôre using to just one item per transaction. Please fix this."
"While I appreciate the mobile ordering and deals so much, I‚Äôve actually had TONS of problems when using it at various restaurants. My assumption is this is a franchise issue as opposed to a nationwide problem so I grin and bear it. I understand that technology is great when it works and that none of the McDonald‚Äôs store staff created the app BUT, if it‚Äôs not working and I clearly have a heavily discounted or free item coming, I don‚Äôt want to then be asked if I‚Äôd like to purchase it at regular price. Prior to the app, any store could adjust order totals based on a mix up or misrepresentation. This should still be the case. The app functions as a virtual coupon that is valued like any other‚Äî if it won‚Äôt scan, that isn‚Äôt my problem but McDonald‚Äôs. 

So, as I mentioned, it‚Äôs great when it works and I really do appreciate it!! The above criticism is only offered in the hope it can make a good system great."
"I was using the app and i was using the deals page which is unique. But, i got a buy one get one of the 10 piece mcnuggets, a big mac, and a quarter pounder. i used the deal through the app and was able to go up to the window. But the lady at the window asked for my card because it didn‚Äôt go through, so i gave her my card. Then when i looked at my bank statement it showed up the purchase of a little over $10 and no longer registered my deal. i threw away my trash along with the receipt before i caught the error. so unfortunately i am no going to be refunded this purchase and a big waste of my time. this made me quite furious due to the lack of ability to refund my card because i was told i was paying $5 and not $10. If i were to use the app and if you get to the window and they ask for your card, i would just say no and decline the transaction so they don‚Äôt charge you more than the price you saw on your screen. I‚Äôm aware it‚Äôs more of a app issue than a employee issue, but it doesn‚Äôt excuse the fact i paid about double what i was expecting."
"Update : I received developer response asking to call a number. When called, the rep was not ready to take my complaint/HELP letting them know about app login issue and escalate it if I don‚Äôt provide my email address. Mr Developer, I called in spent my time to help fix YOUR app. Pls have courtesy to respect my privacy and fix your app.... you Guys don‚Äôt deserve the courtesy of a customer who is trying to help. 
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-\
______________\
Man this app does not work at all. Even when on cellular network with full bars it has issues connecting to internet. I cannot order without login, login won‚Äôt work because app cannot connect to internet. Basically use less. It should
at least have a guest option. I am not sure why a company like mc Donald‚Äôs don‚Äôt have this feature. May be it‚Äôs time to replace their app workflow designers. Such a basic functionality. Sry, you lost my mobile business. Also, I cannot use iOS password generation to fill in my password. Cannot paste a password. Even my bank allows it as it‚Äôs much more secure to use unique password generated by Apple than forcing us to enter one. Pls ... Think ! ü§î"
"Last year, the app had a glitch with the Happy Meal. I called, I was send some free coupons in the meal, and it was fixed. I use both the ‚Äúpick up and pay‚Äù and the great coupons. It has made feeding my kids in a hurry a breeze...and affordable. I save up the ‚ÄúMcCafe‚Äù cards to use in a pinch or special moment. You get credit for ANY McCafe beverage, which I like. Then you are free to use your coupon for ANY beverage or ANY size you wish. I‚Äôve never had problems with this before but this Tues when I purchased 4 McCafe beverages, I only received credit for 1. I called the number today, Friday. The woman I spoke to was just as friendly and helpful as the gentleman was last year. She more than fixed it, and she did it fast and efficiently with a wonderfully pleasant attitude. I hate calling any customer service...I dread it. But both times it has been great and resolved for me. Thank you."
"This is the absolute worst app I have ever used.  It requires you to choose a specific restaurant in order to see ‚Äúdeal‚Äù coupons, but then changes the restaurant location while you‚Äôre ordering - and doesn‚Äôt tell you until you‚Äôre done that it switched to the closest location. Then it allows you to change the location only after it detects that you have arrived at the restaurant it selected. Insane!!!  The menus are difficult- you have to scroll endlessly to find the items you want. This means you can‚Äôt do it easily at a red light... you have to do it in advance which then leads to the restaurant switch. It also automatically puts you‚Äôre last order in your cart. Who orders the exact same thing every time???  I deleted this app. I would get it again only if three things were done: 1) allow searches for items based on keywords like ‚Äúmocha‚Äù; 2) allow users to permanently choose a location unless they want to search the closest; and 3) allow previous orders to go into a favorites where they can be easily pulled again but do not stay in the cart.  Hope someone at MCD is reading these reviews."
I actually love the ease of this app when it works. As a single mom there‚Äôs been more than one day dinner plans don‚Äôt work out and this makes life easier without having to wait 20 minutes at the window to get everyone‚Äôs order in. I even switched from Starbucks to here to get my coffee every morning for .99. About a week in to my coffee switch the app won‚Äôt work or let me use my deal at all saying I checked out before completing my other online order (which makes no sense). I deleted the app and then it couldn‚Äôt re download so I paid full price which wasn‚Äôt an awesome pre-coffee experience. I got it to download again at home and everything worked fine just not when I needed it. I‚Äôm not mad about $2 but this isn‚Äôt the first time there issues with deals and I don‚Äôt have this problem on other fast food apps- it takes away from the experience and incentive especially when you‚Äôre in a rush.
"App seems to have worked fine but I never got my food. Downloaded and entered card info, placed my first order. Checked in at 12:06 pm. At 12:18 no sign of food so thought I would call the store. No answer after 6 minutes so decided I would go in to inquire. Walked up to sign that said mobile order and waited a while. Nobody waiting the counter but a few folks standing around waiting for their food. I finally got someone‚Äôs attention in the back and explained my quandary. They asked me if I was Jessica and I said no, I‚Äôm Steve. They asked what I had ordered and left. In a minute somebody else came and asked if I was picking up order for Jessica. I said no, I am Steve and I check in to Spot 3 about 25 minutes ago. They asked me again what I had ordered so I showed them the order on my phone for which I had paid $13 and change. At that point my wife was texting me asking where was lunch so I left. Went to Wendy‚Äôs and got my order in four minutes. Sorry, McDonald‚Äôs, the app experience was terrible. Fortunately What-a-Burger is under construction and will open soon."
"I just downloaded this app yesterday and tried it. Amazing!!!  I hate waiting in the drive through, trying to hear whatever they‚Äôre saying through the speaker, having to repeat it many times, then have the person from the next line cut in front, out of order. I just pulled up to the mobile curb side spot and had my food in two minutes!!!!  I ordered and paid before I left the house, so I didn‚Äôt have to pull out my wallet and deal with all that. None of those things are what o would call true trials of life, but it‚Äôs still great to bypass it all. The next step for McDonalds, is to figure out the delivery thing.  And with the coupons I was able to go through at home on the app, I paid $2 for my meal!!!!  Please bring back the super size fries!!!!!!!!!  It‚Äôs not McDonald‚Äôs fault what people order and when they can‚Äôt have self control."
"UPDATE 2: Months later, they respond. I think that‚Äôs pretty telling. I‚Äôm not going to bother, which is what I‚Äôm sure they hoped. Won‚Äôt use the app again either. 

UPDATE: it‚Äôs been 2 months. Still don‚Äôt have my money. 

And McDonald‚Äôs is ignoring me on Twitter. This app charged me several times for an order I made, but never completed the order. By the way, you can‚Äôt cancel or modify an order once you‚Äôve started it, possibly due to bugs(?) so I couldn‚Äôt use the app anymore because it kept adding new items to the same original order, without allowing me to remove any items. I deleted the app and reinstalled, and now my order history is gone. I ordered the sandwich at the register instead and was late gettin back to work because of how long it took. I paid $6 for a $2 sandwich. When I tried to submit feedback through the app, I found the feedback form to be broken. I messaged the company both privately and publicly on twitter, no response. Too bad, I found this app to be quite convenient until it suddenly stopped working. I‚Äôm pretty disappointed in the company for lack of response."
"I placed a mobile order at the restaurant on San Jose Blvd. in Jacksonville Florida and they did not receive the order despite having a order number and the app itself saying I was at the right location. 

Edit: after the transaction was refunded I decided to get the app another chance. This time at the restaurant on old Saint Augustine Road in Jacksonville Florida. I submitted a very simple order: a quarter pounder with cheese standard. I submitted the order on the way to the restaurant, when I arrived on that block the app recognized I was there, I pulled into the drive through and told them at the speaker which order I was, they said to go ahead and pull around. At the first window it took them getting a manager to get a receipt from the system. At the second window I was told they still had not made my order that I submitted in adv and instructed me to wait in one of the parking spots. For a simple quarter pounder with cheese. That is unacceptable. McDonald‚Äôs has the worst online ordering experience of any app/restaurant I have ever used. If it were not for the deals that are through the app I would never go there again."
"I love being able to place my order thru the app since we tend to have a lot of customizations, but always have issues connecting to the WiFi when getting to McDonald‚Äôs half the time I get can‚Äôt connect over and over have to get out of my car and go in just to connect and have the order go thru which kinda take away the whole curbside advantage given I still have to go in but love the online only specials and deals you get, and the ease of customizing orders with no confusion at the drive-thru speaker. Plus being able to favorite items instead of adding and having to re customize the order every time makes it much easier too, another plus using the app to order can most often be much faster than placing a order at the drive thru during rush hour times. If it wasn‚Äôt for the WiFi issues I‚Äôd totally give it 5 stars!"
"I agree with other reviews that this app is in the  upper range of fast food apps, but the last three  times I have used it there has been a frustrating glitch.  When I get there to pickup my online order, the button to notify of my arrival at the restaurant disappears as does the record of my order. The first time I had to give my order again in the drive through. On the second occurrence, I made a mental note of the order number before I left home. When I arrived and the button disappeared that time I was able to have the manager of the store look up my order in their system without having to place the order again. The same thing happened again today. It sounds like a petty thing, but it completely defeats the purpose of ordering ahead when you have to wait in line for someone to hunt down your order before they start to prepare it. Please, fix this very annoying issue."
"I can‚Äôt place an order from the app any longer.

It will show the location I want to order from. It‚Äôs will even say that it‚Äôs open 24hrs for example. When I go to order from the location it will then say that the location is now closed and will reopen at 12am for example.

I went to the store and the store was open. I wanted to order some nugget meals but they said they only had the items available on mobile offers. I explained that the mobile app was not actually working and showed it to the cashier who looked at me like I was crazy before. They said they could not ring up anything larger than 10 nuggets and I wanted to order the 40 nuggets and was gonna cost me about 4x the cost of the mobile order. I decided I would not purchase my food that day at that location, it was not worth the trouble. A few days later we are still having the same issue across multiple devices and accounts. Not cool! Maybe it will be fixed in another release‚Ä¶"
"I decided to download and use this app since there‚Äôs a restaurant less than 5 minutes away from work.  The app is wonderful, the stores ability to process it is an epic fail.  First, unlike other fast food apps where you specify when you‚Äôll be stopping by to pick up your order, McDs doesn‚Äôt start peeping your order until you check in at the store.  Okay so at least I don‚Äôt have to wait in line.  But you are... added to the backlog they have at that time.  So you sit and wait.  I also love the ability to customize my sandwich easily in the app.  Not so much at the store.  So when they started processing my order after I checked in they took that adorable customized order slip and put in on the next standard issue sandwich‚Äôs that came up.  Not only did I get the stuff that I didn‚Äôt want on the sandwich but I didn‚Äôt get the stuff I paid extra to add.  None of this do I learn until I get back to the office.  So 5 minutes away, I have to drive back, go inside and wait for my order to be remade.  Yea, I won‚Äôt be doing that again."
"Let me start by saying this app has been wonderful in the past. There are many deals available and they have been a wallet saver in the past. As someone who eats McDonald‚Äôs numerous times a week, the only available in the app discounts were amazing. Today I ordered breakfast and used the free hash brown with the purchase of at least a dollar like I do daily and was given a total. When I went through the drive thru, I was suddenly charged a different amount than I was originally given with no way to dispute it because my card was already charged. I was suddenly charged for the hash brown that was supposed to be free. I have to watch every penny I spend so it was an unnecessary expense I now have to factor into other things, which is completely inconvenient during this holiday season. 

I never had an issue before this, but since I‚Äôm limited on funds, I cannot use this app anymore since it‚Äôs possible to be charged for ‚Äúdeals‚Äù with no way to recover that money. Just beware that your order can change totals without your knowledge."
"WTH is wrong with this location?!!! This is the 3rd time I have placed an order and this freakin app doesn‚Äôt know the screwball way this location is ran!! The last time I was ordering ahead for breakfast (@ 9:45am)and when I made it to the location which was 15 min after finishing my order this location said that breakfast was over but the app wouldn‚Äôt load the lunch options for me to change my order!! Now I‚Äôm at this same ü§¨location and I went to put in the stall # in and the app said that that option is closed at 7pm so choose pick up inside or go through drive up!! We chose pick up inside because we‚Äôre in a 3500 Silverado diesel and we don‚Äôt fit in this tight drive thru! Went to the door and a worker said no mobil order is in the parking spots we were already in, told her the app said it‚Äôs close so she made us wait in the drive thru line to tell them AGAIN that we have a mobil order and to get through this ü§¨drive thru we had to drive on the curb!!!! Then get to the pick up window only to have to tell them AGAIN it‚Äôs a mobil order!!!!!!"
"I ordered through the app but it wouldn‚Äôt let me because I was ‚Äútoo far‚Äù from the location. It was totally annoying to only be able to order once I was in the parking lot. Why even use the app when I could‚Äôve ordered AND received my food at the drive thru or in the store?! Like why not allow for mobile order from up to 2 miles away? That equates to maybe a three to five minute drive maybe? Also, there‚Äôs not status update for you to know if the food is being prepared or when it‚Äôs ready. I‚Äôm in no way using the mobile app to order until this is changed. The best mobile app experience for ordering food so far is Papa Murphy‚Äôs and Jack-in-the-box.

One other thing, there are only 3 options for customizing your order. None, Regular, & Extra. My kids like sauce but the regular is too much so it would be great for a ‚ÄúLight‚Äù option. You can do that in the store and drive thru so why not be able to do that on the app?"
"Twice now I‚Äôve had issues using my bank card, switched to my PayPal debit, and been overcharged until that account is empty. I‚Äôve probably been overcharged over 20 or 30 bucks. I thought it was a fluke the first time. But the staff couldn‚Äôt find the order, but gave us the food. I had sent my son, and he told them it overcharged, but they had no way to refund or verify. So sorry. The second time my husband went. Issue with bank card, so he switched to PayPal. Before he could transfer the money into the PayPal acct(we don‚Äôt keep much there) it cleaned us out for a partial payment for the order. Then once we got the money in, full charge, then it charged again for the remainder of my balance. Then staff couldn‚Äôt find the order. My husband was showing them the app order and the PayPal Acct with over 40 dollars taken for a 27 dollar order. They had to call 3 managers up to the district manager before being told they could give us our food. No mention of the money. At this point, an hour into the issue, it was late, so we left it. Won‚Äôt keep using this app. It‚Äôs too expensive for me!"
"I was very hopeful in this app. I‚Äôve only ordered through the app 2 times and both were my worst experience at Mc Donald‚Äôs and were the longest waits. The first time I ordered the food online and sent my husband to pick up the order. We have 6in the family, so it was a large order. He logged into my account, but when he arrived he could not check in or view the order. None of the employees were able to help him. He had to re order he spent 30 minutes until he finally got the food. Tonight we decided to give it another try. It was nice that we were able to copy the order from previously, but it went downhill after that. After successfully checking in, We waited in the pickup spot for almost 20 minutes. We finally went inside and employees were on their phones instead of making our order. When we finally got the food (7 combos all with no onion) Three  of the burgers had onions on them and my kids would not eat them. I paid for bacon on 2of them, but none had bacon. I won‚Äôt be visiting this location again, nor will I use this app. So disappointing."
"Downloaded this recently. The app is very easy to use but order processing was frustrating. I placed an order, tried to pay with Apple Pay. The order went thru but soon after I got a notification saying that I‚Äôd have to pay when I pick up my order. The whole point of this order was curbside pickup. So thankfully there was a cancel order button (which some fast food apps don‚Äôt have - I give them a star for that, they don‚Äôt charge you until you pick up the order). I tried to order a similar meal but this time used a deal in addition to the original order and I tried to pay with a credit card instead of Apple Pay. I got a support error that told me to try again. So I changed my internet connection from cellular to WiFi. Same order, same payment and same result. I tried again on WiFi, same order but went back to Apple Pay and got the same result. Needless to say, I gave up. This is a great idea but clearly the app has issues that need attention."
I love Krispy Kreme Doughnuts but the location in Charlottesville Va is having problems every single time I go in or drive up. Last week I ordered a chocolate covered cream filled and a banana cream. Got to the they were having a problem make Banana cream. 3rd time I have tried to get that one. Got on the road and my chocolate cream filled was custard filled. Called the location cause that happens a lot. Did not answer their phone. Yesterday not enough help for the buy one dozen get one for 1.00 had a problem ringing the deal. Said the rewards thing was down. Twice the glaze machine was not working. Ugh I give up
"Installed the app and tried signing up for the Rewards Program. Enter my info and get a message that I already created an account (I did?). Select the Forgot Password link and get an e-mail with a 4-digit pin. Type the pin in, and get an error that the pin # can‚Äôt be found. Request new pin, get new pin, type it in: same error. Went through it 3 times without success. There is no customer service link or contact to follow up with, so I think I‚Äôm done trying.

UPDATE:
Tried to give this app a second chance. Again, I was told that I already had an account (I do not). Tried a bunch of my commonly-used passwords and none of them worked. So, I tried the password recovery option and was given a screen to input a 4-digit PIN that was being sent to my e-mail. I exit the app, check my e-mail, get the pin, and go back into the app to type it in (takes maybe 5 seconds max)... and the app has reset to its home screen! I can‚Äôt get back to the PIN input screen, so I try again and... in order to get to the PIN input screen, I have to request a new PIN (the ‚Äúold‚Äù one sent 30 seconds earlier no longer works). Yet I can‚Äôt exit the app to check my e-mail because it will loop back to the home screen every time I do so. Sensing another endless loop of futility was beginning, I quit trying. How am I supposed to input the PIN when the app goes back to the home screen EVERY time you exit it?!?"
"I don‚Äôt usually write app reviews but this app genuinely infuriates me. 
Trying to sign in fails constantly. I have no idea why. I used Sign In with Apple but it insisted that it couldn‚Äôt work. So I try create an account normally. But of course Apple doesn‚Äôt remember the keychain generated password it recommended so tha didn‚Äôt help. (Less the apps fault but still annoying) After a while it some how works I literally did nothing different. I go in and try to place an order because there‚Äôs a deal going on. I select my store but as a try to order it insists that the one store that is close to me has no donuts. It instead show coffee under the donuts tab and Merchandise under the coffee tab. I tried reopening the app thinking it was another bad glitch. But nothing worked and eventually the sign in issue came back. I just wanted donuts on sale man. I check the website to try and order but apparently it‚Äôs the same issue No donuts. Weird right? A hot and ready sign yet no donuts. No donuts at a donut shop. I‚Äôm losing my mind at this point and I decide to check at another store. Would you look at that! They have donuts! And everything you could ask for. So why doesn‚Äôt it work for my store? Who knows because there is now way to ask for help in the app. Also the other store is way too far away. Just my luck."
"We Love the doughnuts‚Ä¶ but your app bites! I logged in using saved password on keychain. I tried manually entering info, I deleted and reinstalled the app, powered off my iPhone and restarted. I stood on one foot and made an antenna from foil‚Ä¶ ( ok I didn‚Äôt do that one, but you get the drift.) it says the credentials are invalid, it won‚Äôt send me a verification. It will not let me make a new account with same email because apparently it‚Äôs only useless when you try to make a different account. I tried to login from FB and it says it‚Äôs unavailable‚Ä¶ someone out there in donut land does not want me to order donuts‚Ä¶ so‚Ä¶ When you fix the app‚Ä¶ we‚Äôll get donuts! ( at least our new years resolutions are safe until whenever your IT people figure out how to make the app work. ( btw I‚Äôm on iPhone iOS 15.3.1 Also.. my birthday was Jan 15‚Ä¶ and I did not get my birthday donuts! Maybe at least the app will work soon?!?!? It‚Äôd be awesome if something went right this year! Thanks for letting me vent‚Ä¶"
Ok so I love your doughnuts so I asked my mom if she could Order some and she said yes so she ordered and she ordered herself two doughnuts and we went there and she didn‚Äôt get her doughnuts that she Deserves because she works so hard she doesn‚Äôt have a job because my grandma and grandpa and one of my uncles and my grandma goes to work and my uncle my uncle drives himself so work and my grandpa drives my grandma to work and my mommy has to clean feed me play with me cook food feed my pets take care of our foster puppies I‚Äôm public home schooled so she had to log me on every day almost and she doesn‚Äôt even get 2 dumb doughnuts give and last time she ordered she didn‚Äôt get her doughnut treat my mom good you mean brats I can‚Äôt believe I like you stupid doughnuts I should go to dunking doughnuts or somewhere else that treats my mom hood oh and you‚Äôre so expensive it‚Äôs 25 dumb dollars to order doughnuts and 13 dollars to go on the store how awfully mean you are to people I love my mom your brats I hate you
"There‚Äôs a menu, which shows all their products, and tells you all about them, but doesn‚Äôt let you place an order. The only thing you can actually do with the app, is pay for your purchase at a Krispy Kreme Store, if the store has the scanner, and it works. To do this, you have to enter your credit card information, manually, because it won‚Äôt scan your card. Then you have to transfer funds from your card to the app. Then when the cashier rings up your order, you hold your phone under the store‚Äôs scanner, and it takes the money. It keeps track of your purchases, so you can collect rewards. Once you load money from your credit onto the app, you can‚Äôt get it back out. You can only use it to buy doughnuts, and only if the store has the scanner. Instead of making purchasing their products easier, the app makes it more complicated. Sort of defeats the purpose."
"We came and there were no doughnuts except the pink and chocolate sprinkles. We were going to get kreme doughnuts but then so random stupid person came and took all of them. There was a coupon in the app that said buy a dozen and get another glazed dozen free. We were going to get that but then it didn't go through. We asked for the manager and see of he could do something, but the worker said ‚Äùthe local manager couldn't do anything‚Äù. The worker didn't do anything, acted like he didn't care, and kept on pretending to act like he cared by saying ‚Äùsorry‚Äù. To top off this horrible event I scanned my app 5 times to get the rewards the worker even said: ‚Äùok, it scanned‚Äù. However, on the receipt, it doesn't have my app name(so it didn't scan) and I didn't get the rewards. Never trust the workers, the Krispy Kreme app, and the Krispy Kreme store. Never coming back again, the app offers are fake news, I'm telling everyone I know( which is a lot of people) to never go again.ü§¨üò°üç©ü§Æ"
"This app has a fatal bug.  I‚Äôd give it zero stars if I could.  When I try to sign in, it says my credentials are invalid.  When I try to reset my password, it says I previously signed in with Facebook.  When I try to sign in with Facebook, it says it can‚Äôt find my account.  This is an endless circle, and I am not able to log in on the app or website.  I tried contacting them through their contact form, but it always makes me include a store location (even though this error is not tied to a specific store).  A phone call led me through a series of voice messages and never to a live person, and there also was no chat box.  Sometime later, after leaving a comment to who knows who, they sent a coupon in the mail with no return address so that I could write back.  It is for a free doughnut for my troubles, but they never addressed the problem!  I still cannot log in anywhere."
"I liked the app at first as I thought it would keep track of my points but it doesn‚Äôt track purchases reliably. Even worse, recently I purchased points in-store and was charged 3 times but the points never credited so I had to go back to my credit card company and initiate a time-wasting complaint, I‚Äôll end up spending an hour on it to get my money back. This is the absolute worst thing that can happen with an app, 2 stars are only for my early experience. Don‚Äôt try to credit in-store with this app (or wherever WiFi is spotty), if you want to add points, do it when you have a reliable WiFi connection well before going there.  In addition, some of the newer store employees have a lot of trouble using the app to take payment and have to call their manager over."
"I filled out the information for the Rewards Program and I noticed I want given an option to put my birthday. I called the number, but it was giving me all types of options other than to talk to a Customer Representative for the app or anything. So, I emailed them and was given an apology about people not receiving their points. I made sure to be clear and concise when explaining my issue and was given an irrelevant reason. I ended waiting about 6 days to see if they at least changed it for me or would contact me back, but nothing. I emailed them again and it's been 6 more days and no response. Very unprofessional on their part and clearly they do not care about others. It seems silly to be upset about this, but I have been extremely patient about this and the whole experience has deter me from ever going to any Krispy Kreme or products as a first time consumer of the brand."
"I personally think it‚Äôs a really good app you get great rewards for shopping there. If you don‚Äôt shop there very often or aren‚Äôt willing to go you most likely won‚Äôt like this app. If you don‚Äôt go regularly or even once a month you don‚Äôt get many rewards you will get a couple of coupons and maybe even a free donut but that‚Äôs about it. If you are a regular or you come once a month and you use your app when they scan, you earn points and then you get things like a free donut or a free dozen and if you save your points you can even get free keurig coffee things that go in them... which may I say they are REALLY GOOD!!! So if I where you and I went to Krispy cream often I would totally get his app you will save so much money and you won‚Äôt regret it. üëç"
"Just as everyone else having issues after this forced update over the weekend, I can‚Äôt log into my old account that had over 4,000 points! I spent several hours trying to reset the password until I saw all the recent reviews and realized that the problem wasn‚Äôt on my end, so I left it alone patiently waiting for a fix. I know my points are OK for now when I tried using my registered phone number in a store, but I have no control over how my points are being applied - the system is trying to give me ‚Äúfree stuff‚Äù arbitrarily and not when I wanted to redeem the points, like in the past. Very frustrating! The old app worked like a charm and the new rewards system is not better in any way.

Please fix this problem and send out an update confirming the issue is being resolved, so people stop wasting their time and getting frustrated for no reason!"
"I ordered on the app with 2 different different cards, & my my money was withdrawn from both accounts without actually completing my order. I contacted my local Krispy Kreme (the worker was extremely nice), but they did not see my order in store. I was given a 800 number to call, but unfortunately COVID-19 has customer service hours only for a short period of time during the week and Saturday's. I‚Äôm not upset with Krispy Kreme as a company, but it‚Äôs very frustrating to have the ease of using an app, only to realize the app withdrew money from my card without processing my order. Now I have to wait until customer service opens at 9am cst on Saturday just to prove to customer service that I made 2 purchases and never received what I ordered. It‚Äôs safe to say that I won‚Äôt be using the app again!"
"The app mostly never works - it has only worked once out of the many times I have tried to use it.  Whenever I login and start an order, the screen is always just blank and none of their donuts show up.  The only thing on the screen is to click ‚Äúdonuts‚Äù or ‚Äúcoffees and drinks,‚Äù but there are never any donuts or coffees and drinks to click and order.  As I said before, just a blank white page.  This is a consistent problem - the app is just terrible which is unfortunate because they advertise such great deals, such as free delivery on any order.  I‚Äôm not one to write reviews, but this is getting ridiculous.  Why have an app in the first place if it isn‚Äôt going to work?  Also, it is not just me who has this problem, I‚Äôve asked others about it and they have the same awful experience."
"Too many software bugs and customer support sounds uninterested, Ill-informed, and unwilling to help. Had a error with entering card info, and the app ended up charging me twice. Called to get the amount credit back. Rep said the request was sent but couldn‚Äôt give a confirmation number or TAT OR ANYTHING to let me know the request was actually sent. Called back 3 business days later, new rep tells me there‚Äôs no request open for me; tell her about the initial conversation, she turns the whole story around  ‚Äúwell if she said she sent it, the it‚Äôs there. We don‚Äôt  have confirmation numbers or email correspondence but something like this takes about 5 business days.‚Äù üôÑ okay but you just said you didn‚Äôt a case open with my registered email... once I get my money back Krispy Kreme has lost my business FOREVER."
"I love Krispy Kreme but the app isn‚Äôt working for me. It said I already had an account with my email but I never made one and when I tried to reset the password through email I didn‚Äôt receive one. I made a new account w/ a different email this time it didn‚Äôt ask me to input my birthday and on my profile it says to call a number to change the birthday. I don‚Äôt want to call just to put in my birthday, I‚Äôm not even trying to change it - just put it in for the first time. After that it logged me out and now the app closes when I press ‚Äòlog in‚Äô and I have to either make yet another account or just delete it. Please help KK I really would love to have the app."
"I love their donuts, they‚Äôre the best; but I have issues with you guys‚Äô delivery system. A week ago I ordered a dozen donuts for delivery. They took the money out with the quickness, but cancelled my order no sooner I placed it. Turns out it was an issue with their system & my order was never sent to the store. So I instantly wanted my refund. Well I‚Äôve emailed them multiple times, I even called them yesterday & I STILL haven‚Äôt heard back from them! It‚Äôs been a whole week at this point, I want my money back! Your app is good when it comes to making a pick up order, but idk what you‚Äôre trying to pull with that delivery stunt y‚Äôall pulled. & why hasn‚Äôt anyone gotten back to me about my refund? Fix your delivery system."
How do you get the free doughnut for downloading app ? I don't see a message or a link to send messages. The card seemed like fun until I started reading the negative reviews. I probably just old and slow at figuring out the app üòú. I suppose the best option is to physically walk in the store and interact verbally with the employees and maybe a fellow customer or two. Shouldn't expect anything for free because they are in business to earn money to support their families. I would prefer to not be teased with a free doughnut üç© if I download the app but after I download the app I search for the free doughnut but cannot find it üòè. Thank you anyway KK for making the best doughnuts I've ever tasted! I hope you don't let it go to your head and start treating customers poorly because we will take abuse to just get a hot fresh now doughnut! üòÇüòÇüòÇ.
I wanted to get points so I could get rewards so I decided to put $15 with my card into the app. When I went to the store and tried to pay they couldn‚Äôt take out the money so I had to pay myself. I went ahead and went to another store another day to try and see if maybe it was just the employees but the employees at the other store could not take the money out either. They even tried transferring the money to a gift card and that didn‚Äôt work. This app has a lot of issues. It also states I have a free donut but there‚Äôs no way to redeem it. I ended up emailing customer service about the issues because I felt that I was robbed by the app and to this date there is no response. This is horrible. I went ahead and disputed with my bank. They really need to fix their app ASAP.
"I‚Äôve been using the other version of the Krispy Kreme app and I updated today. On the website and emails they‚Äôve sent it said that I would not need to register for a new account and that my points would be converted and transferred. But when I went to log in, it said I had to create an account??? And then I even tried to reset my password and it was not valid, I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on but this needs to be fixed. I had enough points for a free box and now I can‚Äôt even get into the app. When I tried to make an account it wouldn‚Äôt even let me either.

Update: I finally got into the app after reinstalling it, but alll my points are gone, I had enough for a free box and I was promised that my points will vary over but where?!!!! I want my points back"
"Of course their donuts are amazing, but everything else is as well. Often people tell me they think it‚Äôs too expensive, but I explain how KK is actually less expensive than all other donut stores. Between the coupons (mail, paper, email, etc) & the rewards program (app) I never pay more than $11 per 2 dozen (hot & nows &/or picked-assorted). On top of all that I get free dozens from the rewards. So amazing donuts at an amazing price!!
 ‚ù§Ô∏èüç©üíöüç©‚ù§Ô∏èüç©üíöüç©‚ù§Ô∏èüç©üíöüç©‚ù§Ô∏èüç©üíöüíöüíöüíöüíö"
"I wish I could get into the Krispy Kreme App. I tried everything for the last month or 2. Every time I log in the app logs me out. I have a iPone 8. I event took the app off my phone and tried re-logging back in. Each time I try it kicks me off the app when I click log in.

Luckily each time I have gone in the last two months Krispy Kreme has been able to determine my account by my phone number. But it would be nice to be able to access the app like I used to to see what rewards, offers are available after two months. 

I like what it does offer with a dozen donuts or regular donuts.

I wish there different rewards like if you buy mini donuts or buying drinks besides coffee. My family really does not drink much coffee and we may visit the restaurant normally in the afternoon. 

I also wish there was a Krispy Kreme closer to Amelia Island or in NASSAU County rather than a Dunkin‚Äô Doughnuts or driving all the way to Jacksonville. There is not many breakfast restaurants where we live except for the Waffle House or Dunkin‚Äô Doughnuts so a Krispy Kreme would benefit our town."
"I love Krispy Kreme. Seriously, it‚Äôs an amazing product. However, this app (at least my experience) is far below the standards of their restaurants. I downloaded the app thinking it would be as easy and streamlined as others in this segment like Dunkin and Starbucks. Those seem to work smoothly and allow me to reload cards swiftly and with no glitches. 

However, the Krispy Kreme app has gone completely off of the rails. I downloaded the app, set up my account, attempted many times to load funds onto my account with multiple methods of payment and every one of those triggered a ‚Äúwhoops! Something went wrong‚Äù message. After quite a few attempts I deleted the app to try again another day.  Today was that day. I downloaded the app again, logged in, tried to load funds and again was greeted with ‚ÄúWhoops!...).  I know these MOPs work as I use them daily and have no issues except for the KK app. So it is now deleted, again.

Hoping that Krispy Kreme can Trouble shoot this as I love their product but this app falls short of their reputation.

P.S. allow touch ID instead of continually logging on."
"For one, you‚Äôre not actually able to make purchases in the app. Instead it routes you to the website which prompts you to input your email and password, which does not save. Also when I tried to remove something from my cart, the drop downs do not have zero and there is no remove button. Since the purchase is not in the app, you cannot swipe either to remove. On top of this, if I log out and re-enter, the things are stuck in my cart. Aside from the rewards this app is not very useful. I plan to purchase from the store and scan for rewards which is almost pointless."
"Krispy Kreme used to have it where you could order anything and just accumulate points and spend those points on any product in the app. Now, you have to purchase that specific product in order to receive and redeem points on that specific product. I loved how you guys had it before. I always purchase your variety dozens and I would treat myself with a coffee every once in a while, but now it‚Äôs requiring me to always purchase a coffee in order to be able to redeem a coffee.. Please go back to the old rewards!"
"The app had been recently updated and I had noticed the points history button is not working. It had before the update anger does. I‚Äôve attempted to tell app support who‚Äôs really customer service about this issue. Instead of a simple reply like ‚Äòthank you, we‚Äôll let tech support know‚Äô I get ‚ÄúYou may have to contact iPhone to see if they‚Äôre having issues on there (‚ÄúApril- Krispy Kreme Customer Experience‚Äù made the typo) end.‚Äù Umm, excuse me?? April had said this twice. I‚Äôve kindly tried to explain that this is not an iPhone issue!! Krispy Kreme‚Äôs app has a broken button. How is that iPhones issue?
At this point I‚Äôm fed up explaining. ü§Ø"
"Edit: So for the first day the update worked. But now we‚Äôre no longer able to log in, and the app is telling us the account isn‚Äôt recognized but we‚Äôve not changed anything, same email used for the last 6 years.. 

Hi, your app isn‚Äôt optimized for the current iOS, and we‚Äôve been on this iOS for a few weeks now. There were betas for said iOS as well. Not having an optimized app, while also encouraging customers to sign up for deals and rewards, is a very bad business strategy and I‚Äôm unsure why Krispy Kreme, quite a major brand, is dawdling here. Users can‚Äôt even open the app without it force closing on them. Please update soon."
"On June 27th Krispy Kreme advertised a promotion for rewards members. If we purchased 2 dozen donuts we were to receive the Krispy Kreme sunglasses. That afternoon when I stopped in to buy the donuts and get the sunglasses, I was told they were all gone. They informed me that they had just been handing them out to every customer that came in!  As many as they wanted!  I showed your email that explained the promotional to the young lady at the counter and she said they knew nothing about this being a special item.
Doesn‚Äôt management at the stores read your documents?
This was the store in Harrisonburg, Virginia.
Just a little disappointed."
Well we dearly love Krispy Kreme. We do not have one near us so when we planned our vacation we decided to go through Lubbock where there is a store. All 8 of us traveling together got out of our vehicles excited to start buying our doughnuts. When we got in the store there were very few doughnuts we couldn‚Äôt believe our eyes we went ahead and bought two dozen of what they had of course none of our favorites. They looked like someone had set on several others were very small others were oddly shaped  & very greasy needless to say they even tasted horrible so in the trash they went. 8 people left very disappointed & we will see how this complaint is handled to see if we ever go back again!!
"The app is good overall.  Easy to order online from your local store, easy to track and redeem rewards, easy to add payment methods.  But I just purchased a gift card and wanted to add it into the app to keep up with it.  Can‚Äôt figure out how to do that - apparently there is no option to add a gift card.  Really??   In this digital age, that‚Äôs really a must.  If you are going to run promotions on electronic gift cards, then make it easy for us to use them.  Krispy Kreme - step up your game."
"I wonder if app support or anyone from Krispy Kreme actually reads these reviews because you have some pretty upset customers trying to use it and losing points and patience with what appears to be no response. 

I downloaded the app a couple weeks ago but could not get signed in. This morning I signed up a new account and got into the app but it‚Äôs pretty much unusable - the rewards and offers page won‚Äôt load and crashes the app - ie throws me out of the app, and pretty much any other menu choice does the same. All I have been able to see is the location stuff. 

Running iOS 11.4.1 on iPhone X. And hoping to get at least one free donut for downloading the app as promised!"
"I wonder why I have to wait 30 minutes to get cold donuts ! I‚Äôm more than willing to wait for hot donuts because let‚Äôs be honest, they are worth it! But if I go through the drive thru when the hot light isn‚Äôt on.. with the expectation that the donuts are cold, I don‚Äôt expect to spend much time waiting...especially when there are no other customers in the drive thru line and there are sparsely maybe 4 or 5 cars in the parking lot! Every time I go to this park meadows location the workers act like it‚Äôs a hassle to serve...  maybe I‚Äôm wrong, but I thought that was why they‚Äôre paid. Krispy Kreme is an awesome donut shop but park meadows give them a sour taste!"
"Got a $10 e-gift card from my mobile provider. Instructions are to show it to cashier. I show cashier and she looks puzzled. Blames it on that it‚Äôs not loaded into the app. I say it‚Äôs no big deal and pay cash and decide to come back another time. I come to find out that there is not a section to load gift cards on like every other major company from Starbucks to chick fi la.

I‚Äôm not giving it a 1-star because of my poor experience in store.

I am giving it a 1-star experience because you the app will only take new money from a debit card. I am not able to use my ‚ÄúKrispy Kreme Gift Card‚Äù which are American dollars that are only valid at a Krispy Kreme."
"I had used the app and paid for 2 dozen donuts to be delivered as a Christmas gift.  I just realized today when placing a separate order that my last order was never delivered. Although bought and paid for my order is sitting in limbo. Nobody has notified me of problems with the delivery.  Even worse, when I select the phone number to call to discuss online orders, the number is not in service!  I love the donuts and service when I pick up or walk in, but online delivery and related online service is a complete failure! On top of it, I look bad because my gift was never received! Thanks a lot Krispy!"
"Their product may be sweet but their tech and this app are not.  Every message every received remain cluttering the inbox long after no longer relevant.  The menus don‚Äôt match the actual selection at the local store.  There‚Äôs no way to order ahead to have selections ready upon arrival.  The mobile payment system within the app is useless when the store‚Äôs system can‚Äôt receive payment from the app (leaving funds stuck inside the app, wasted).  

There‚Äôs much work to be done here and such a large chain ought to be able to handle it.  Sadly disappointed."
"The app let me add a couple donuts to my cart and then when I went to check out it told me those donuts are not available. If you‚Äôre not available then why did you let me put them in there. 
And then when checking out it gave me an error message so I started over from scratch and when I got to Krispy Kreme I had four dozen donuts instead of two dozen. The first order went through even though the app told me it didn‚Äôt and the people in the store just said ‚Äúyeah both orders went through; they‚Äôre both yours. go ahead and take.‚Äù thanks a lot! now I have four dozen donuts and I spent twice as much as I want to"
The Krispy Kreme app is very convenient when it is working. I would give it a five star except it hasn‚Äôt been working for at least this month. I constantly get errors when trying to make a purchase. I have to close out the app to get it to work again. Then today I went to order some doughnuts for Halloween and when I get on the app it only shows drinks in both the doughnuts and drinks tabs. Basically worthless for what I needed it to do. Now I have to go wait in a long line so I might not have time to buy any. Sad.
"So many of the top 5 star reviews are people simply reviewing for rewards of some kind. The app is entirely unusable. You cannot create a new account. You cannot sign in with facebook. If you attempt to use it as a guest, it crashes after you select a delivery location OR pickup location. After it crashes, you can no longer use the app as a guest, and you get eternally locked into the sign in screen where the user is given 502 ‚ÄúBad Request‚Äù or ‚ÄúBad Gateway‚Äù errors. There is something seriously wrong with the server running the mobile website as well as the app, and until its fixed, this app is absolute garbage."
"I used to use this app about every month just fine. Signed up/in through Facebook, got my rewards and all that. Updated the app, signed in, and it‚Äôs making me go through everything like I‚Äôve never used the app before. I checked my email to make sure I had the right one, I did, and tried to sign in again. Still doesn‚Äôt recognize me. And it pops up an error message saying ‚ÄúUh oh! The data couldn‚Äôt be read because isn‚Äôt in the correct format!‚Äù WHAT DATA?!? I hadn‚Äôt typed anything in. It wouldn‚Äôt have let me continue through everything if I had entered the data wrong. All my info and saved points are gone."
"This app is beyond broken and non-functional. I tried to do a custom order of donuts an the moment I hit the button to customize my order the entire application hard crashed and closed. The one time it didn‚Äôt the only option for a doughnut that I had was the glazed donut. There were no other options, I couldn‚Äôt choose any other doughnut so I tried an I hit randomize my order and it crashed again. All of this on a day where the two only Krispy Kreme establishments near me are both having the same malfunction with her machine. All I want are some freaking donuts."
"I‚Äôve been a K-K addict for over a year now and go out of my way, about 20 minuets, to get to my store.  I‚Äôve  got over 825 points and I‚Äôve probably cashed in points for a dozen glazed dozen.  I love the program almost as much as the donuts. 
PROBLEM: They need to clean up ‚ÄúMessages‚Äù or make an easy way for me to delete the expired offers.  I‚Äôve got them going back to June, 2017 and can‚Äôt get rid of them. 
                              FIX THIS‚ùóÔ∏è"
"I am so happy that Krispy Kreme is still available. I really miss watching my favorite donuts being made in Orem, Utah. I originally got into Krispy Kreme several years ago in Orem, Utah. Thank you for creating my favorite donut shop app. I will definitely be visiting everyone at Krispy Kreme shops and buying my favorite donuts and treats from stores that carry them. I also love coffee. Thank you very much."
"I wanted to use the app feature to pay so I added $30 using my credit card it gave me an error so I thought it was the card type, I used a debit card to repeat the process and got the error. No funds were added to the app but the transaction processed from my bank and 2 times from my credit card. Essential I wanted to add 30 to use. And they took $90 without reflecting it in the app. I have tried to reach out but there is no good contact info available I ended up submitting a concern thru the website With return contact info but have not received a response."
"The first thing I noticed was the inaccurate store info. The location nearest to me has a drive-thru but the app says no drive-thru available.  Then I discovered the only way to  pay through the app is with a credit card. What if I want to use a gift card? I bought gift cards for my kids so they could use the app, too (they don‚Äôt have credit cards of their own and I‚Äôm not about to put my card info in their apps). If I can‚Äôt rely on the app for accurate store info and I can‚Äôt use my preferred method to pay, why keep the app? I won‚Äôt."
"Since downloading the app a year ago, I‚Äôve tried everything in the word to get it to work so I can use it. I‚Äôve been told it‚Äôs unable to connect to my Facebook account for whatever reason. I created an account but it never sent me an email. Then when I go to log in with the apparent account, it won‚Äôt let me, and if I try and send a new password to myself, nothing ever gets sent. If I try to create a new account, it tells me I already have one. I‚Äôve deleted the app and reinstalled multiple times and I think I‚Äôm finally done trying, which is too bad. There‚Äôs no winning with this thing."
"Yep,, I know when the best donut in America is hot now!! There‚Äôs not another donut shop in the world that has the donuts being made in front of the customer. This app rocks on so many levels!! I grew up with KK‚Äôs. That‚Äôs what we called them back in the 60‚Äôs. We would all load up in the car and go get KK‚Äôs,,,, usually on Sundays after church,,, and sometimes they were hot!! It‚Äôs a great day for the consumer when we know the KK‚Äôs are hot!!!"
"I have had this app 2 months in conjunction with a newly opened location.  This app hardly every works. At the store, never once have i been able scan for the rewards program - they must ALWAYS enter my cell number to record a purchase for rewards.   Offers come to my email (not the app), so when I click the offer, it opens the app, but the special offer is not there and i have to go back to the email.  Finally, my new location just doesn‚Äôt exist... at least as the app is concerned.  KK... i LOVE your product... your app should reflect the quality of your product"
"I ordered online twice. I never got anything for both orders. It would say it was delivered when I never got anything. No refunds or what! Call the branch they would say they don‚Äôt know what happened or that they don‚Äôt deliver. Such a big company, can‚Äôt coordinate anything. If a branch can‚Äôt deliver then don‚Äôt put them as they can, if you can‚Äôt deliver food, cancel it, let your customer know why and issue them refund not the other way around. Tried calling customer service, NOTHING. Tried sending an email to customer service, BIG FAT NOTHING!!!!! This company doesnt know even the basic customer service stuff."
Great design but I can‚Äôt find my rewards points from the old system. I need some assistance. I recently updated the app to the new Krispy Kreme experience and I am a huge fan of the redesign! However upon further searching I can‚Äôt find where my points transferred over from the old system. Still a fan and will continue to love y‚Äôall but a little frustrating.
I‚Äôve never had any issues with the app it does what it is supposed to. But why can‚Äôt I add the rewards card to Apple Wallet?  Just about every other app from a food company that uses a rewards feature allow you to add it to the wallet for convenient access. Some places even have it show up on the lock screen for even quicker access. Just a thought
"First off, app doesn‚Äôt work without full location allowance. So glad I can have my battery dead by lunch time by allowing KRISPY BLOODY KREME to know my exact location even when not using the app. Fantastic. Also, the whole reason I downloaded was a lie. No free doughnut for app ordering. No special deals. Just Krispy Kreme‚Äôs way of saying ‚Äúwe know where you are and aren‚Äôt willing to offer any positive experience in exchange for this luxury‚Äù 
This app is beyond terrible. Why are there still so many braindead morons saying this app works? It doesn‚Äôt fulfill any of the intended or stated purposes. Wish I could give it less than 1 star."
"KK IT says that they have never seen this before. Have you?   I am using an iPhone SE with current iOS, have tried an American express, and two different visa cards.  I get an ""error - try again"" dialogue box almost every time I try to use ""Transfer ."" Occasionally, randomly, it will transfer. 
 I have tried my wi-fi,  LTE, and KK's guest wi-fi, all with bad results. I dumped and reloaded the app. I also restarted my iPhone. 
Also the ""replace saved card"" switch does not work. I had to go into my profile to remove the saved credit card. 8/4/17."
"I used to be able to buy doughnuts and get rewards based on my spend, but now KK has revamped the rewards so all purchases are ‚Äúcategorized‚Äù into donuts less than a dozen, doughnut dozens, coffees, and specialty coffees. I now have to buy a dozen orders of a dozen doughnuts before I get a free dozen. It is *much* harder to get rewards now, and frankly, not worth it anymore. Best thing about this app is the hot light feature, but I‚Äôve discovered it isn‚Äôt as accurate as one would hope. This app has gone from essential to a waste of time. Deleting."
"Ok so I have no problems actually using the app, and enjoy the doughnuts. But my complaint is that every time the ‚Äúhot and now‚Äù light apparently comes on I get a notification on my phone. No matter where I am or how far away. No biggie, I can go into the app and turn off notifications right?  Well, I did that... turned off notifications in two separate places within the app. Couple of days later and it‚Äôs back on, and I certainly didn‚Äôt activate it. STOP MESSING WITH ME KRISPY KREME!"
"Did KK recently change their rewards program so you can‚Äôt choose your rewards?  I liked that I could accumulate points, and then use them as I choose.  Sometimes I get a donut.  Once, I saved up for K-cups.  
Now I‚Äôm seeing that there is no rewards point tally, but that I have a free dozen.  What am I going to do with a dozen?? AND it expires in December!  Points down the drain?  I used to be motivated to earn points, but no longer.  The fun is gone!
And if I‚Äôm wrong, and everything‚Äôs the same, and I just haven‚Äôt figured out the app enough to know that nothing has changed?:  Lousy version!"
"The app with its rewards system was one of my favorites. However, after redesign and reward system change - it‚Äôs completely useless. Take this for example, before if you buy a couple of dozen donuts you could score a free donut or coffee. Now if you buy 11 coffees, plus 11 donuts, plus 11 dozen - you will have nothing, like literally, with new rewards system you can spend more than a hundred dollars and not score a single free item. The design of the app is also bad and there is no way to link gift card to the account."
"I love the app, but the employees rush check out and NEVER ask if you have the rewards program. I spent over $100 once and they said, ‚ÄúOh, sorry, we‚Äôll catch it next time. Ummmm no, you need to fix it now. That‚Äôs 2 dozen free donuts I would be giving up. Look KK already closed once in Billings, let‚Äôs not make it twice over crappy service. Finally a manager said, ‚ÄúMam,
I will fix it for you this time, but it‚Äôs not
our job to ask. Well gee wiz gomer pike even Starbucks and JCP ask you if your a reward member. Hello, it keeps people
coming back. Remember KK donuts
aren‚Äôt a necessity. If I get that service again I will go to my local bakery, they sell bread, croissants, rolls, oh and donuts!!!
Please be kind, and rewind the attitudes!
Take a lesson from Starbucks,
I waste $17 a day there, and I don‚Äôt care because they respect me."
"First time I used this app it was great, was able to pick the drinks I wanted and customize a dozen with all the current flavors. Since then it‚Äôs hit or miss. Last week, the option to customize a dozen was missing and only box of joe coffee available. Yesterday I could customize my dozen, and no speciality coffee, and today no donuts at all show but there are pages of coffee options on the donut tab. If you need a complimentary UAT tester, let me know, just do something to stabilize the experience."
Placed an order for pick-up yet the app shows no order history & also didn‚Äôt give an option to save my card info when placing the order. I was not given a receipt so I couldn‚Äôt even get credit towards my rewards. It makes no sense to have to still scan in to get rewards when placing an online order. This should be like any other app such as Dunkin‚Äô or Starbucks where the rewards points are automatically added.
"You‚Äôre app and website are useless. If I push to start an order it goes to doughnuts but shows nothing to select, Same for coffee etc. there is simply nothing there to select. I got it to work one time! But then had trouble me with something else so had to start over and again doughnuts are missing to order. I give up. I‚Äôve tried both your website and app with the same problem. I will just order treats from somewhere else."
Before the Krispy Kreme app I was lonely and depressed but since I have started using this app to find hot and fresh doughnuts my life has been completely transformed.  Just this week I have found over 4 dozen hot doughnuts every day with the app and I am so thankful for whomever created this app. I could not imagine my life now without doughnuts for breakfast lunch and dinner.
"The old Krispy Kreme app was great. Then I started getting emails about the new Krispy Kreme app and the new program. I was excited at first, but then I realized that instead of receiving a dozen free donuts after buying five or six dozen donuts, I now had to purchase 12 dozen donuts. They essentially doubled the amount of donuts that you have to buy in order to get a free dozen. We almost always eat our donuts at the store as well, but the app doesn‚Äôt take into account me purchasing drinks or milk, only donuts.  I don‚Äôt believe this was a good move for them at all and I will probably stop going there."
"I think this app is horrible. I have tried to use this multiple times, but it does not let you create a custom order. Each time I check my store it will only let me order a dozen glazed donuts only. 

Occasionally it will show a potential order for a mixed box that is pre selected, but again not let you create your own box even if you set it up for the next day. I have also noticed I will get an email for a special, but that is not available to order either."
"I love Krispy Kreme glazed donuts. They remind me of the glazed donuts I grew up on. The only difference is in upstate NY we had bakeries on just about every corner. Jewish, Italian, etc. and the glazed donuts were not hot out of the oven. We liked them just the way they were. That is the way I like them still. They have plenty of glaze on them like when I was growing up and I prefer them not to be heated."
"It‚Äôs august 8th and I wanted Oreo donuts. Unfortunately, when I tried to check out with a few in the dozen I picked out, it said that they were available until 7/29 and to redo my order. It‚Äôs also frustrating when I go to pick up my order 10 minutes after it‚Äôs supposed to be ready and I take them by surprise. And then my order is wrong. It was a frustrating experience today."
"We are unable to add purchases to our account through the app. When entering Springfield, MO as the shop location, we receive 11 stores to choose from, none of them in town.
The assistant manager was unable to override a reward on my app and since I paid for everything, she suggested I add the purchase through the app. Another employee said our location hasn‚Äôt shown up on the app for a ‚Äúlong time.‚Äù
I was jazzed about points and rewards and supporting a fun shop in town. This app has made our Krispy Kreme experience LESS enjoyable."
"The main reason for the app is rewards and offers. In the new rewards system it‚Äôs broken into four categories and you have to buy 12 items within a category to get 1 free of that type of item. Also, quite often the purchases don‚Äôt even register. I‚Äôve contacted customer service twice and both times they claim it will hit the account but it never does.
Now, for the offers, half of them only hit my email and don‚Äôt even show up on the app..."
"I have yet to find a store that 1) has a scanner to scan the app, 2) has a WORKING scanner, 3) knows how the program/scanner works or 4) participates in the rewards programs.  Employees seem untrained or uninterested in the program. Last two trips I was told the scanner didn‚Äôt work but give us your phone number and we will credit your act. I did....they didn‚Äôt. 13 trips to Krispy Kreme and have yet to get a single reward point. Zero! Rewards hotline said get a receipt and call us every time and we will credit your act. Sorry but I‚Äôm not going to work that hard for a free donut."
"What is the point of loading money onto this app if they can‚Äôt process it in store? 
This is the third time I‚Äôve gone in store with my phone and they couldn‚Äôt process payment. I had to go back out and get my credit card, when I had over 12 dollars loaded on this useless app.
Starbucks makes it easy, I can even order before I get to the drivethru and pay with my phone without ever having to interact with a single person!
Get it together Krispy. Your coffees not that amazing."
"Usually love the app, and it‚Äôs convenient to order online and pick up, as well as submit missed transactions towards my rewards progress. I haven‚Äôt been able to access the app for the past two days and get a message saying unable to securely attach to the server whether I‚Äôm at home on WiFi or out on LTE."
"Be careful with this app.  I ordered a dozen donuts handed the cashier a coupon for $3 off one dozen and my gift card that had a remaining balance of about $2.50.  As I waited for her to tell her how much more I owed her she said, ‚Äú you had enough credit for a free dozen so AFTER  I scanned your coupon and took the balance of your gift card, you don‚Äôt owe anything.‚Äù  I told her that‚Äôs not right, I just gave you  almost $5.50 towards my donuts which means I‚Äôm not getting it free.‚Äù  Her response was, ‚Äú I‚Äôm sorry but that‚Äôs the way the new app works.‚Äù  I would give the app less than one star if I could."
"I went for St Patrick‚Äôs Day for the double dozen donuts to bring to work and share. I saw there was an app and have been a regular. Decided to download and put to use to get some rewards for being loyal. As I open the app to input this transaction it shows that my Krispy Kreme is not on the list, and therefore I can‚Äôt redeem the transaction/points. Yet when I use ‚ÄúFind A Shop‚Äù it‚Äôs there; WHY!? There is only one in town and the next is 11 miles away, this needs to be fixed in the app or I will just use another donut franchise that can reward my loyalty."
"The last 3 times I‚Äôve tried to use the app it refused to log me in. Even when I reset my password and tried to log in 2 minutes later I got an error message that my login info was incorrect (I wrote it down and saved it on my phone so it couldn‚Äôt have been wrong.) 

When the app works I love it. Maybe to combat this issue there should be a way to scan got receipt so you can still earn points."
On ios and it‚Äôs kinda difficult to order for pickup. There aren‚Äôt a lot of doughnut options.  If you wanted only half dozen of assorted not all the doughnuts would be on the doughnuts selection side same as for assorted half dozen. Always want to order ahead but it‚Äôs so difficult. It‚Äôs just better to to walk in. App works fine for just a reward scan or redeem.
"I have apps for nearly every restaurant and fast food place available, and this is by far the worst. Frequently, the app won‚Äôt let me log in. I just got an alert from the app, and I connected directly to see what the alert was - couldn‚Äôt get logged on after repeated tries. It would take my fingerprint, and then the little donut would spin and spin until it timed out. It‚Äôs almost like they have 24,789,623 people trying to use an app designed to be used by 125 people. Just awful app. The developers should never be hired to make another app for anyone."
"I used to love this app but now it can‚Äôt seem to keep track of points (I‚Äôm still at 4 credits after buying three or four dozen), always seems to be down and though employees always take my phone number to supposedly put in points, my balance never changes. All my old points (I had several hundred) are gone. Haven‚Äôt had a reward since the update even though I go twice a week; it‚Äôs starting to feel like a scam. So sad, I always looked forward to going and seeing my points rack up"
"Horrible App. I was able to use it once when I first downloaded it but now it won‚Äôt let me checkout or it doesn‚Äôt even recognize the location which I‚Äôm trying to get from. I don‚Äôt need to go inside, I have a pet and need to get it from the window but the fact I have deleted the app and download it not for it to work is frustrating. I love the donuts and I love the service team and I love the company but too bad the tech side is nowhere near as good as Krispy Kreme. This app does not do this amazing company justice."
"I like the app and chose to sign-in via Facebook. Never had an issue until now. I keep getting ‚Äú App Not Setup: This app is still in development mode, and you don't have access to it. Switch to a registered test user or ask an app admin for permissions.‚Äù Tried going on their website to see if I can change to an alternate sign-on, no option to."
My first time ordering through the rewards app and it charged my card. The app gave me an error about my rewards and the order never went through on the store‚Äôs end but still charged my card. I  Contacted both the store and the customer support number and neither were able to assist me. I was told that by customer service they are unable to help me with online orders.  Now I have to dispute with my bank! fix your app!! ü§¨ This ruined my morning because this was for my job!
"Definitely not a high quality or highly dependable app for that matter that one would expect from a corporation to release. Very difficult to navigate, logs you out at nearly every page change, and no real way of saving your favorite store? Mine keep defaulting back to Jacksonville Fl and I live in Virginia? Anyway, I digress, it needs desperate attention perhaps even they should look at a different developer to take over the project to make it more user friendly and streamlined."
I love Krispy Kreme App...points are added fairly quickly. My problem or pet peeve is why cant we erase our messages after they have been opened/read/received. They are not necessarily taking up memory on my phone but it irritates me that I cant delete messages from February 2017 and it is April 2018. Other than this...love it!
I like the app for the rewards. Has been very beneficial until today. I tried to check my app for my points. I wanted to redeem them before I go out of town tomorrow. But the app is telling me ‚Äúsomething went wrong while trying to open app‚Äù. Everything is updated they had an update last week to fix bugs... but def still has one right now.
Tried to put in a missed transaction on app to get rewards. You have to pick your location first and my location was not on the drop down menu. Emailed using the email provided in the app. Response to email was ‚Äúsend us all the info and we will put it in and you‚Äôll see the results in 7-14 days.‚Äù Great - but you didn‚Äôt address the problem of my store not being in the list of local stores!
"I would give this 0 stars if possible. They changed the rewards system with 0 notice a couple years back and you lost all rewards you had. Now, the app won‚Äôt even work at all. Open it and it either crashes immediately or I get a pop up that says ‚Äúuh oh! The data couldn‚Äôt be read because it isn‚Äôt in the correct format‚Äù Just horrible customer service to have a garbage app for such a big company. Pathetic would give 0 stars if possible."
"This app works fine on a very basic level. My one major complaint is the payment method. Right now it only allows people to add a credit card but I have gift cards that I use, but every time I get to the cashier, they have to manually type in the barcode number, since the barcode itself won‚Äôt scan properly. If I can add the gift card to my app and pay straight from there, that would make my transactions so much smoother and faster."
"This app is amazing, and yes I come to my local store weekly. 
But recently the app either doesn‚Äôt recognize My email or it will close the app. This needs some bug fixes because I know each visit rewards you with points, and yes I can still give my number at the cashier, but when will I redeem any of my points if the app is not working?"
"I bought a fundraiser card. I can‚Äôt use it on the app.
I tried to order a dozen assorted donuts. The app tries to charge them individually instead of buy the dozen.
I told the store employee that the app was only letting me select a few donuts, not the entire menu. He said the store manager sets it up that way.
Everything I would use the app for (to order a customized dozen, to use a coupon) I can‚Äôt do on the app. So the app is almost entirely useless to me."
"Since the update, app doesn‚Äôt load. Only shows the icon but doesn‚Äôt do anything after that. Luckily my KK allows the phone number for points. But can‚Äôt see what I have for rewards. This is why I wait to update until forced because there‚Äôs always bugs in new updates."
"This app is just ok. One thing is that they don‚Äôt have a scanner at the Akron location so they have to take your phone(unlocked) into the store. Where the register is located I can‚Äôt see them. Also, my birthday rewards don‚Äôt show up. I received the email and followed the instructions but once I got there the cashier said it wouldn‚Äôt work and acted like I had already used it and was trying to get free food. It‚Äôs only a doughnut and small coffee. Get over yourself lol"
"Today is only the first of many times I‚Äôve tried to log into the app to take advantage of a special offer, use my credits, or register a purchase, only to get the message ‚ÄúNetwork Unavailable.‚Äù  It‚Äôs NOT referring to my own network capabilities because I can use other apps at the same time I get this message from Krispy Kreme. 

When I can log in, the app is fine, but so often, I can‚Äôt log in to use it."
"I have to log in every time I open this app. It never remembers my account information, and I‚Äôve had to reset my password many times because the app doesn‚Äôt trigger my phone to recognize it as a user name and password to save. Also, why does this app not take Apple Pay? You lost my order to Dunkin‚Äô today, because I could Apple Pay in their app without having a card with me."
"Sorry, but I think the New Update of this app is worse. It takes too much longer to get rewarded. Can't get rid of messages- old messages- not sure why there isn't a delete ability especially after the message is old or expired. I LOVED THE OLD APP because it seemed you got a free donut or free drink much quicker and it made me go back to Krispy Kreme more. I MISS THE POINT SYSTEM too! Now it takes so much longer and I feel I will not go back as much as I use too. PLEASE CONDSIDER revamping your app rewards- not much of a rewards program anymore."
"I always know when it's hot now it pops up on my phone yay. But when I go to my local Krispy Kreme and I want to turn on my app 

The appIt made this up. I‚Äôm adding in my part. Sometimes works.  But took all my points at end of March. This years too. The last 2 visits it‚Äôs made me religious in and won‚Äôt take my password. The folks at the window are very helpful and always understanding no matter what time. 
 

it never does I have to sign in with my phone number which frustrates me and the people at the window I never know what the points are actually going to get on there or if I have to keep my last receipt so that's a bummer all the way around."
"I like the concept of this app because it is nice to have been a pinch when you don‚Äôt have your wallet on you like I tend to do sometimes but if I can‚Äôt load money onto it using my card then what‚Äôs the point of having the availability to pay with the app, every time I try to do it I keep getting an error message or being timed out is really something that needs to be fixed in order for the app to be effective, if that‚Äôs the case I‚Äôll just pay with my card"
I had 5 dozen free donuts. Just went into MV location and It showed no rewards. Several months ago I purchased 12 dz for work. They automatically used 4 of my rewards. I was saving them for another time. They cancel out the transaction. But I never received my rewards my rewards back or for the current purchased. Staff said I needed to call corporate office. I emailed with no response. Frustrating Staff has no idea how to check app or anything about the app. Or give rewards. Of course no manager was ‚Äúthere‚Äù to help either.
"I downloaded this app because I buy donuts for my coworkers a couple times a month. Every time the app has updated, all my points have disappeared when I log back in. I had enough points for a free dozen donuts twice and when I updated the app all the points disappeared both times after logging back in. This is very frustrating. What‚Äôs the point of having a rewards system if your points get reset after every update? Please fix and give me back my points"
When my phone updated it's made my app not work it says that I'm not even in the system and when I try to get in the system it say not valid email account I'm disappointed cause I was very close in point to get a free dozen but can't login with my email and I made an account when the shop opened up in my home town wish I could get help with login account and I also can't even reset password or nothing ....
Somehow I created my account via the app but other than that; this app offers NO advantages over simply using a web browser. Any time I try to order it redirects to Safari and after enough attempts at hitting the ‚Äúorder now‚Äù button it logs me out and displays an error message stating ‚ÄúThe info seems to be in the incorrect format‚Äù. Only when closing the app and restarting my phone does it allow me to log in. I cant stress enough how pointless this app is for me in its current state. Please do something.
"Ever since the app went down for maintenance my app isn‚Äôt functioning correctly. I‚Äôve updated it to see if that would help but it didn‚Äôt. I lost ALL of my reward pints, the app is constantly force closing, or not opening at all. I wish you could enter your phone number or add your barcode to Apple Pay to earn and redeem points. I no longer feel the need to have my app nor go 45 minutes out of my way to go to this chain. Really dissatisfied because i was just about to redeem my pointsüò©üôÅüôÑ"
"Was happy to finally getting my first reward. But today went to buy two dozens and decided to not use the reward (i had a coupon from a local fundraiser instead), and marked on the app to not use it when scanning. Reward now completely disappeared from my account. Double checked my receipt and got charged for one, and shwos fundraiser promo for second, no mention of the reward. Just gone. What is the point of the rewards then?"
"We all love your donuts 
We get them every Saturday for our Salon not too far from
Your beechmont location , the clients just love love them so much , that's one thing they look forward to now along with a cup of hot coffee amd of course there hair for the day !! 
Keep up the good work ... We will continue to be a good customer !! 
Carla"
"In the app you should have the ability to type in a tip amount for your driver for delivery/no contact delivery. Even selecting the max (20%) feels too small if you‚Äôre only ordering 1 dozen. Makes me feel cheap, and I don‚Äôt always have extra cash around to leave for the driver."
"On the app it says I have only bought one dozen of donuts and zero coffees!!! I have bought at least 20 dozens of doughnuts since downloading the app and becoming a rewards member. And I always purchase at least 2 drinks each time I go. AND they can never scan my phone with the barcode, they always ask to TAKE my phone and type it in manually EVERY single time. That‚Äôs not sanitary and they haven‚Äôt even been giving me my points! Waste of my time."
"I love Krispy Kreme and love their rewards program but when you want to customize you can‚Äôt seem to choose one flavor more than once. For example, I ordered a 3 pack custom and wanted 2 cake batter and one raspberry filled. You don‚Äôt have the option of adding 2 of the same flavor. You get an error message."
I‚Äôm convinced this app doesn‚Äôt accurately reflect my purchases. It needs a history option like Starbucks app. I just bought 3 dozen and 2 coffees 2 days ago but have no coffees on my app and only 3 dozen on my dozen rewards. I should have more dozens plus the 2 coffees. Keep and check your receipts! I give two stars because I‚Äôve had the app a long time and I have earned a free dozen but it took way longer than expected. I should have earned a free coffee by now!
Ok thanks for the email and the phone üì≤ is ok with me and the phone and I am not sure if you have to go to the phone or if you want me to call you or text him and see if you have the information ‚ÑπÔ∏è thanks for coming in and thanks üòä
I have been to 3 different locations in San Antonio and have witnessed employees literally arguing over the app. I tell them ‚ÄúI need to pay with my app‚Äù and they always say ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt do that.‚Äù Really?!?! Then why does it give me the option? Why can I load funds? I utilize KK a lot for work purchased $130 worth this Saturday did I get any of my points? Nope. Did I get to use my app to pay? Nope. Why? Because your own employees have no idea how to use it. Why have an app if you‚Äôre not going to train employees how to use it?
"You would think with all the negative reviews they would fix their app! Downloaded app and try signing in, and it said I already have an account. Try signing in with forgot password and the app shut down. Now can‚Äôt even open app, it keeps shutting down! You would  think that whoever is in charge would have the app fixed! I guess when you get to be a big corporation you forget the people who help get you there! SHAME ON YOU!!!"
"I love being able to place an online order, cruise into the donut shop and smoothly glide out with my order already boxed and bagged. The true disappointment comes when you realize after ordering 4 dozen specialty donuts online you reap none of the rewards. Very, very discouraging and depressing. I will no longer order online"
"I have been trying to get my profile information changed. I have been calling Krispy Kreme for over three years. I have talked to several people. They keep saying, they are going to pass the information to the guy that update this information. I heard that three times. Now when you call it doesn‚Äôt have an option for customer service. I think I will go with Dunkin‚Äôs Donuts they work with their customers."
"I am having difficulty finding a location I went to. I am trying to enter a receipt from when I went to a Krispy Kreme yesterday and the location isn‚Äôt showing up on the app under the rewards section. But, when I search for locations near me it pops up. It makes no sense. In addition, I have no one to contact as far as helping me with this issue."
I‚Äôve had this app for a little while now and always thought it was a little faulty. I‚Äôve always been able to use it in store fine though. But I just checked my app and now all of my points are gone. I guess they expire??? It would‚Äôve been nice to know that just because I don‚Äôt go to KK very often. Honestly don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll use it just cause my points expired so quickly!
"Krispy Kreme are definitely my favorite donut shop! Will always choose them over others! The coffee on the other hand is terrible. The girl made a fresh pot and I was unable to drink it, threw it away. I am a big coffee drinker so that is disappointing BUT I am giving the 5 stars because I go there for the donuts!"
"Signed up when I got there, there is wait before you get the coupon, it showed up 2 days later. It‚Äôs been about 2 weeks since then and the welcome coupon is gone. I‚Äôm going to a local doughnut shop next time just because the app upset me and lowered my opinion of Krispy Kreme in general. Lesson is don‚Äôt tell me about a deal than fail to offer the deal after I do my part"
"Update: my local KK closed, so I didn't know about the new point system. I've now moved, updated the app, and see all the offers in a new tab. Can they delete the offers once they are expired? I'm tired of seeing these offers from months ago! 

Original:
I have had this app for a few days. I have made two purchases and none of them are showing up in the points section. There is no description of the reward system (what dollar amount equals how many many points). I'm disappointed.

I have emailed three times. The first time I was told to wait up to two weeks. At two weeks, I sent another email. No response. After three weeks I send another email. So far, no response. Also the app never asked for my birthday, which it listed incorrectly..."
I can no longer sign in using social media. Can‚Äôt start a new account because I have already registered my email via social media sign in. Can‚Äôt reset my password because I was on a social media account and so never had a password. This app is basically telling me my business is no longer wanted at Krispy Kreme - and naturally my birthday is this weekend and I‚Äôll miss out on a birthday treat while this incompetent app fails to work. Guess I‚Äôm no longer a customer eh?
"Saturday mornings I leave my house at 6:30 AM and I drive 28 miles In The opposite direction I pass one Dunkin‚Äô Donuts, two quick trips in one race track just to get me Krispy Kreme!
I usually get a couple of dozen for my customers in employees of Goodys Barbershop!
And this past Saturday being St. Patrick‚Äôs Day LOL we REALLY enjoyed the green donuts!üòéüíàüíàüíàüíàüíàüíà"
"App is good. Was better before. But still use it because of the donuts. 

However, you do not receive any rewards credit for soft drink, milk, or juice purchases. My wife doesn‚Äôt drink coffee and the kids surely don‚Äôt need it. So frequently purchasing 3 beverages with no rewards. 

PLEASE FIX IT!!!"
"The app is an inaccurate representation of what is actually available, and the inability to order what‚Äôs available is very frustrating. The app consistently says that an assorted dozen is unavailable, but it still allows for over a dozen doughnuts to be added individually. If an assorted dozen is not available, why can a customer still purchase a dozen doughnuts at a higher price? Ridiculous and worthless."
"I finally got a reward after buying 12 dozens not even 2 months later my ‚Äúfree dozen‚Äù offer wasn't available anymore I didn‚Äôt even know it expired, send an email to ask and I get a reply that had nothing to do with what I asked, only 2 locations near me that are about 20 mins away. So if u guys get the free one get it right away."
"I don‚Äôt think we should have to go to another donut shop to get what we want 
Can I get some help with nonprofits organization. Last Sunday we went to Dunkin‚Äôs Donuts and purchased 4 dozens and 2 large container of coffee when wanted to purchase it from my favorite place Kreme cream"
"You can only order online which the app sends you too. The hotsign times are never correct, multiple times it tells me it‚Äôs on at 1 am. But they close 11 the latest.  You can‚Äôt insert points after the transaction, but they don‚Äôt ask if you have the app at the window.  They use to give you a donut when you came in and I feel like a lot has changed and it‚Äôs not for the better."
"Ok guys, what‚Äôs going on?  Your recent update is a dud. My app was working perfectly. Now, I can‚Äôt even order doughnuts on the app. All that‚Äôs available are the drinks and coffee. Even when I select the doughnut option it just shows the drinks. This has to be fixed!!! I love Krispy Kreme doughnuts and the app is the most convenient way for me to order on my way to work. I need this to work. PLEASE FIX ASAP!"
"This app is this worst compared to other reward apps. There are never coupons for you to use. You always have to get them from emails. 

Also, the restaurant scanner never works!!!! I put money on the app to use and can‚Äôt because their scanner doesn‚Äôt work. 

I‚Äôm collecting some of my purchases. I can‚Äôt add my receipt purchase to collect my reward because THE STORE I GO TO IS NOT LISTED!!!!

I work retail and we have an app to use. Coupons should be added to use from there. We even have coupons for only those who have the app so I know it can be done!!

I‚Äôve called several times and asked to be contacted and have NEVER been contacted."
"When trying to run this app on an iPhone 11 Pro Max running iOS 13.0, the app crashes on launching. Looks like they didn‚Äôt update the app prior to the release of iOS 13. Someone needs to remind the developer(s) of this app that the reason Apple releases beta versions of iOS is  to allow developers to test their apps with the latest versions of Apple‚Äôs operating systems, so that when a new version of iOS comes out, their apps are ready to run on it. Disappointing."
Well I have been trying to enjoy krispey Kreme and the app for about two months. The first two experiences were very bad and I am giving them another chance for the third time. Today is free coffee and doughnut day for rewards members. And oh how perfect that the App is now down. Keeps signing me out. The app is not very convenient even when it works. But my money is trapped in my app and I can‚Äôt sign in to spend it. If I ever get my money out I will never go to krispey Kreme again
"October 13, 2019: 
App works well. Enjoy the add receipt feature. Like reward perks.

Version 19.4 BAD - October 2019:
Crashes immediately after clicking to open. Before this it worked great and the feature of adding a receipt is awesome so was 5 stars now it‚Äôs a negative 1 star..."
"I‚Äôve gotten emails saying I have things such as a birthday reward or free Halloween doughnut.  However, none of these are loaded to my barcode in the app.  When I contacted support about it, they said I‚Äôd have to show them the email from support saying I should have a reward even though it‚Äôs not loaded to the card in the app.  Seems like a hassle to have to email support for every reward that doesn‚Äôt populate (which has been all of them so far).  Not impressed."
"If you forget your password they make it so hard to recover. Yes you are given a security question, but if you don‚Äôt get that it‚Äôs impossible to recover. They don‚Äôt have password recovery sent to your email and then from there rest your password like so many other apps do. Ugh, very frustrating when you want to continue to be a loyal customer and earn point but the app isn‚Äôt fully customer service friendly or easy to use."
"I have tried multiple times to order donuts off the app and the Layton, Utah location, and I never can. When I go to choose the donuts, I would like the page is blank. I have even tried ordering off their website, and it's the same thing. It's infuriating. Some locations aren't open at certain times, and all I would like to do is order a pick-up, and I can't. Please fix"
Always have great service and fresh donuts! Taking a lot of people that have come in from out of town that‚Äôs never been to a Krispy Kreme . They absolutely love going there ! Everyone I have taken there has really enjoyed their experience a Krispy Kreme! Thanksüç©üç©
"Tried to use it, it was difficult. Finally got it working & used it to purchase some donuts from a local shop, but the ones I bought were ‚Äúpromotional‚Äù and the promotion ended the day before. They could not refund my money in the store & told me to contact customer service for a refund. Customer service told me the app was through a 3rd party & they couldn‚Äôt refund my money either, but to just dispute the charge with my bank. WTH?? Deleting app now & going to Dunkin‚Äô Donuts"
I hope the developers of the app update the app because there is no way one can edit their email on the app. I need to edit my email but I have to go through a long process of a phone call and the phone calls are not reliable. I rather do it on my own. I will give it 5 stars if that option was available.
This is the worst food app.  It‚Äôs clunky and If they have a special offer you can‚Äôt use it if you order online.  They have no method for curbside pickup-in Savannah you have to knock for minutes on a locked door to get your cold donuts.  Better to drive through and wait in line. Total waste of time.  Makes me wish their donuts were worse-because I feel screwed every time I patronize them and drive 40 miles for a donut...
"You can‚Äôt use a gift card on the app or the website. Seriously? Why would I gift anyone a Krispy Kreme gift card if they can‚Äôt redeem it unless you drive to a store? It‚Äôs 2020, nearly every retail app allows you to use a gift card. Took me 20 minutes to place an order because I could not accept the fact that you can‚Äôt pay with a gift card. Lame."
The app is great when it running normally and I‚Äôve previously had good success with it. But for some reason today it‚Äôs acting buggy. No way to go back to look at your rewards if you have something in your cart without losing the contents of you cart. Then the app kicked me out.
"So basically you can choose only mini donuts and orange juice. Under coffee and drinks, orange juice is the only option. A few weeks ago I was able to order a dozen variety of whatever donut flavor I wanted and now it‚Äôs one option. Just don‚Äôt launch your app until you‚Äôve straightened out the bugs. We should be able to choose any assorted dozen, and whatever drinks and other items are on your menu."
"No mobile ordering. During holidays and family gatherings, we often order a bunch of doughnuts. The store generally does a good job but I was hoping to try mobile ordering. I should have read the details first; the app is only for rewards. Also, while trying to sign up, if I went back into the app to continue the signup process, the signup process restarted from the beginning."
"1. Every time the app updates, have to completely login with I‚Äôd and password... don‚Äôt wait to check when you are in front of line.

2. Promotions and pay are not integrated. Email promos not in app and was told today at store...you have to tell me what you want so I can get to the right screen. At La Madeline‚Äôs you scan and promos automatically deducted and credit card is charged...really fast and easy."
"This app relies solely on scanning the barcode at the cashier BEFORE making a payment. If the scan failed, I highly recommend canceling the order and try again which requires manager override.  It makes me wonder how many times the store manager would put up with it especially when the store is fully packed with customers standing in line.  What they should have done is to allow the receipt numbers to be keyed into the app afterward for point earning."
I love using the app to get some discounts. The donuts are always great. It‚Äôs a win-win situation! I think the scan page should be a little bigger because sometimes it does not scan at the register but besides that everything is good.
"Tried creating an account through the web browser. It said I had to have the latest app installed, so I installed the app. Tried creating my account through the app, filled out all fields correctly, and then got an error message saying the data could not be read because it‚Äôs not in the correct format. All I wanted to do was order some donuts!! So frustrating and a complete waste of time."
We drove for 45 minutes because that is the closest place to get hot and now delicious donuts. When we got there we wanted to get a dozen hot and now and a dozen chocolate covered. When we saw the small amount of chocolate that was on the donuts we asked the lady if they could put more on the donut but she said the machine was cut off and they were not able. Other than that I love it
"Donut is good, but the app is bad. The City of Industry, CA store I normally go to often say their scanner has problem, and when I gave them my phone number, they say they cannot find it in the system either. Even worse, when I try to claim a ‚Äúmissed transaction‚Äù for the reward program, the app keep saying error to find the transaction... It was almost like they purposely not give me the credit for the reward program..."
"I am unsure if the App is compatible with ios-13 on iphone, everytime I put in my login information it goes to the next step and then it closes the App and I have to open the App again and put in my login information but I am unable to get pass this step. I have deleted the App several times hoping I will get different results. Is it the ios-13 software or the App needs to be updated to be compatible. Someone Please look into this. Thanks!"
"I'm just trying to sign up and it's already acting buggy. It loses all progress if I close out of the app (not kill it) to go elsewhere to copy my password. Then when I click ""paste"" in the app, nothing happens. I'd really like this to work because my passwords are long and complex. The shortcuts (like clicking on, rather than entering in my phone number) aren't working either"
It would be better if you could scan the receipt after your purchase and be able to get your points. If I don‚Äôt have my phone with me I miss out on any points I could have received.
"I enjoy using this app when I go to kk, however, I receive msgs saying that I have free rewards but nothing appears when I open the barcode. If the rewards do show up when I select the barcode they disappear so fast I don‚Äôt have a chance to see what I can get. The most recent update seems to have caused this glitch with no fix in sight. Please fix so I can Lee enjoying this app to the fullest potential."
I think the team could be more educated on how to use the app. Also it would be great if we could order on the app to pick up in the store like other food apps such as Chick-fil-a and Panera.
I have tried several times to get my free doughnut and I always end up buying a couple a dozen donuts not getting the free one what is the problem with the store having the donuts that‚Äôs on the menu in drive-through this is becoming so difficult and instead of continue  dealing with this app it doesn‚Äôt pull stuff up or the store that I go to in Owings Mills Maryland I‚Äôm bout to just stop dealing with Krispy Kreme altogether
I‚Äôm not sure if this is only happening to me. I downloaded the APP but everytime I try to open it‚Ä¶ it tells me ‚Äúunable to securely connect to server.‚Äù So I removed & deleted the APP & tried installing it again‚Ä¶ but all the same problem. Did this happen to anyone who downloaded the APP & experienced the same problem? I guess Krispy Kreme should check this problem. I believed they need to fix the bug in their APP
"Love the coupons and love the doughnuts.  I wish you would put one in Shallotte, NC. I had to drive 39 miles one way to Myrtle Beach or 37 miles one way to Wilmington to get one and not talking about ones on Grocery shelf. The real hot and now cannot be beat. We have no treats in Shallotte. Pleaseüå∑‚ù§Ô∏è"
"I don‚Äôt like that you can‚Äôt use your reward points with online orders. They make you go inside the store to use them. Also any time I order through the app they give me doughnuts I didn‚Äôt ask for or replace a doughnut with a mini doughnut if they‚Äôre out of them, it‚Äôs annoying that my order is never what I paid for i feel like I keep getting scamed like is this a joke?"
"I do remember a day when this app worked, but it‚Äôs been a while.  If you download and set up a rewards account, I recommend NOT using the Facebook option.  I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs where they broke their own app.  I sent another email this week and got this response:

Thank you for your email regarding our Krispy Kreme rewards app . We appreciate the opportunity to assist you. Unfortunately, when Corporate released an update I caused some minor glitches with the app. As of right now we can not reset passwords for your account. We are not sure when Corporates going to have a fix for this. we do apologize for any inconvenience this has caused. 

On 4/12 another update was released... and yet again the app doesn‚Äôt work.  

‚Äî‚Äî-"
This is a very friendly-user app which makes it an easier and convenient way to get the latest news on my favorite donuts! I also appreciate the free donut when new flavors are introduced!
"I‚Äôve gotten emails saying that I earned or was gifted things (like a birthday reward etc). But no where in the app does it say that I have something or what it is that I earned; how are you supposed to know what to get and before when to get it so that it doesn‚Äôt expire??

Also, I would suggest adding a section where you can submit a receipt for points in case you didn‚Äôt get your app scanned‚Äîlike going through the drive through"
"I love the app, but would like to suggest a few things. First, I think that the start time of the hot and ready light should be listed to let consumers know if they are at the front or back end of the rush. Second, the average time of the light could be listed. Finally, the best idea would be average time of hot and ready light. These suggestions would be great for anticipating the light for customers that want fresh donuts but aren't near a particularly close location."
"I have installed, deleted and reinstalled this app a few times now. Let me first say, I LOVE KRISPY KREME and wish more than anyone I could love this app. 

For some reason, this app never works for me. The rewards/barcode never loads and most recently I can‚Äôt make an order‚Äî I keep seeing a basket error. 

Will delete for now and reinstall later again in hopes that it gets better (only because I love Krispy Kreme so much)."
"I‚Äôve never even been able to fully log in to this app - SO FRUSTRATING! It either gives me the error that my password isn‚Äôt in the correct format or of I can get past that it completely shuts down every time the pop up asks if it can use my location. I‚Äôve deleted and redownloaded the app MULTIPLE times and no fixes. This is so frustrating, really wish you guys could fix this."
"Had the exact same experience as '93 Bruin. They need to hire people who know what they're doing, not just throw a crappy app together and expect people to go out of their way to fix their own Krispy Kreme rewards accounts. Ridiculously complicated and zero support behind it all.  I called at some point and the lady was totally clueless about the app and the website and had no idea how to help me or who to refer me to. I gave up on this a long time ago."
This app works so bad that when I went in with a friend to redeem our free donuts the cashier got so frustrated with the app himself he gave us our five donuts for free and  said ‚Äúwhatever just take them and leave‚Äù so I guess I‚Äôll be using the app again
"My KK app stopped working with one of the last updates.  It won‚Äôt let me log in, app keeps crashing after opening, tells me that I can‚Äôt retrieve lost password, so I‚Äôve lost all the points and freebies I earned!  Sadly this app has become extremely useless and I haven‚Äôt been to Krispy Kreme in months now because of this.  I‚Äôve emailed/messaged KK, to which I haven‚Äôt gotten any responses on how to fix this and get my account back!!  Worthless app now."
"The app is fine for getting donuts and having them delivered because I‚Äôm too lazy to get my own. But I think it‚Äôs pretty dumb that they do not allow me to tip someone what I want to bring said donuts. It caps it at 20%, and even if I order two dozen, that‚Äôs only about $5. I shouldn‚Äôt have to ask the delivery driver for their cash app, Venmo, Google pay, etc."
"Why is there no way to access an order placed the day before pickup? I can‚Äôt make a change, cancel, or even confirm that my order still exists. When I call the shop directly, they also can‚Äôt access my order or even confirm that it exists, let alone change or cancel it. So, now what? I get charged for something I can‚Äôt pick up? This is a huge gap in functionality."
"I went to the website to updatemy password, and the website put up a message about the ‚Äúnewest version‚Äù being required to perform that function.

We have the latest version of the app: updates whenever available. And I sure as heck don‚Äôt know how to get the ‚Äúnewest version‚Äù of the website. (That‚Äôs up to the webmaster, not us.)

The app, and the website, are utterly worthless. üëéüèæ"
"Since the new update it automatically signed me out of my account, which I knew it was going to happen. But whenever I tried logging in, especially with resetting my password, it is asking for my security answer but the question seems like a bunch of numbers and letters, instead of an actual question and I am not able to log in."
"Had this app downloaded for awhile. Error messages kept coming up saying the app won‚Äôt open. I deleted the app in an attempt to re-download it, but when i go to the App Store, it says the app is still installed. I had several free rewards on there and have been really disappointed they haven‚Äôt fixed it in 4 months. Won‚Äôt/ can‚Äôt go to Krispy Kreme until it is fixed and the rewards i earned are back"
"You need to add a payment option to where we can add egift cards and gift cards to the app. You should also teach your employees how to use your registers, two out of the last 5 times they couldn‚Äôt figure out how to put an e-gift card in to pay for my order, so they tried to tell me they don‚Äôt except them, after other employees put them in on visits 1,3,4.... and yes I walked out and you are about to loose a customer"
The rewards rarely register on app and if I try to enter a missed transaction it says it can not be found. I have had this app for over a year and get a specialty drink almost every time but it says I have bought 0 and says I have only bought 5 dozen donuts when I buy a dozen about twice a month if not more.
"App says u earn rewards with each online order, but I ordered a coffee each day for a week and it never registered that I bought anything.  Only when I ordered in person and gave the cashier my phone number for rewards did the app start adding up my rewards."
I used my Facebook logon to set up this APP. I have closed my Facebook account now I can‚Äôt logon because my Facebook account is closed and I have a $25 dollar card on the APP. I have asked them several times if they can help me change my logon so that I can access my account and use my $25 credit but I have never received a response. I can‚Äôt believe they won‚Äôt help me and they don‚Äôt even respond.
This app is pretty to use but it would be great to have an option to load in a gift card.  That way my gift card balance is readily available in my app vs getting frustrated that I forgot my gift card and deciding I‚Äôll stop another time when I have my gift card.
I really don‚Äôt understand the purpose of creating an app with an ‚Äúorder now‚Äù that doesn‚Äôt let you order. It‚Äôs bonkers that I select this simply to be taken to a webpage that requires me to sign in again and select my store. This is dumb. I love Krispy Kreme donuts but it should not be this hard. Clearly the developer doesn‚Äôt understand the purpose of an app.
"This is one of  the worst app ever. I tried to do pick up but it constantly open safari but still won‚Äôt let me order. Then I tried to look up the flavor and again, it opens up safari. What‚Äôs the point of an app if its constantly opening up the safari! On top of, I still couldn‚Äôt order. AND the coupon doesn‚Äôt get linked so I ended up ordering in the store. Utterly useless. I have no idea what the point of this app is"
I never setup a security question. I go to reset password and the security question is a string of letters and numbers; which looks like codes or whatever. There‚Äôs no way for me to even reset my account password! This app had buggy problems even when I signed up! I went ahead and deleted the app because it serves no purpose and I have all the problems everyone else had; except I couldn‚Äôt load money at all.
"I learned to love KK many years ago, and my family inherited the taste.  In 2008, our daughter and son-in-law with their four girls (our granddaughters) moved to Siberia as missionaries.  We visited them, and our granddaughter greeted us at the airport with, ‚ÄúPapaw, did you bring us any Krispy Kreme‚Äôs?‚Äù"
This app isn‚Äôt really good at all. First you don‚Äôt get your free donut. Also this app should have the menu per store so that you know exactly what store has for donuts and such. I‚Äôve read some bad reviews about transferring money from your debit to the app so I will not use that feature. The store has enough counter space to start a order on the go like dunkin does. Maybe in the future but then again maybe not. We‚Äôll see what happens.
"I loaded $5 onto this Godforsaken app a year ago.  I have made multiple attempts , via phone and email to get the funds returned, to no avail. If I could give Zero stars, I would. I have Two Krispy Kremes by me, both owned by the same family and neither accept this rewards program -- I look at other locations, on the app, and Krispy Kreme shops a very few and Very far in between. So, who is creating this app, as it is surely to SCAM people out of the hard earned fruits of their labor."
"I select delivery and enter an address when I start the order.  

WHY do I have to wait until AFTER I‚Äôve configured my order, entered payment info, etc... to find out that no delivery services are available right now? 

Move that to the front of the workflow."
"Love Krispy Kreme, and the new one near our humane society has such nice people I stop a lot: was recently given a gift card; but I can‚Äôt add it as a payment form!!! Every other food app I have let‚Äôs you do this, it‚Äôs a shame KK sells gift cards but you can‚Äôt use it as a payment form!!!!"
"When I go to My Account and select Profile & Security, the app crashes. I have an iPhone SE and currently run iOS 12.1.1. Other than that, the app appears to be working fine."
This app is easy to use for tracking rewards and payment of my order with my digital gift card. I don‚Äôt do much fancy stuff with it but for what I need from it it‚Äôs great. I wish more food apps were as simple to use!
"The app itself is fine. But the people in my local Krispy Kreme don‚Äôt have any idea how to allow me to pay with it (they don‚Äôt even seem to know it‚Äôs possible to do that). So I added funds, but they will probably just be trapped there until Krispy Kreme decides to properly train its employees."
"Rewards program is pure fraud - refuses to acknowledge my last two receipts and doesn't give reward. Missed transactions says duplicate check and nothing else. Didn‚Äôt even let me get free donut when first signed up. Just a scheme to get your phone number and data for their personal gain. Will report all this fraud to BBB and move on to Dunkin, where their app actually works and their rewards are properly tracked and provided."
They just went way backwards as in I will try to find local bakeries for my customers.  They used to give points you could use for anything.  Now they give dozens and even worse is they automatically subtract your dozens whether you want them to or not.  No other customer loyalty reward program FORCES you to use your rewards.  Chick fil A just went from rewards to points.   I like to save my points and DO NO WANT TO BE FORCED TO USE MY FREE DOZENS FIRST.
"First, the app was having trouble logging into my account through Facebook sign in. So I figured, maybe there‚Äôs an issue with the app. I check the app reviews, and then noticed it needed to be updated. I update the app, successfully logged in, but as I was checking my rewards, they are all gone. I was planning to redeem my birthday reward too, but it‚Äôs all gone!"
"Tried to create new account,  got error that account already exists, tried resetting password, got pin through email, inputted pin and password, app gave error but don‚Äôt know why. Tried again, same issue. Then tried to create a new account with a different email and have the exact same sequence of events. Very frustrating. Useless app."
"This app don‚Äôt work most of the time. Rewards are not there like they should. Can‚Äôt order online for pick up. Notifications don‚Äôt notify you even when you have them turned on. With all that not working, why would anyone want to put their credit card info on this app? This needs a big fix and revamp!"
"Really nice way to keep up with latest news and specials from krispee kreme. During football season I enjoy getting the freebies from the points and using the benefit of scanning for specials, where no one else has."
"This is one good app to have one specially when you're wanting something sweet. I love the fact that they have the red light when they're hot donuts ready, takes me six minutes to get there and get my sweets for the day."
"Love how it‚Äôs simple, u can add the card to apple wallet, add last transactions, etc. has many features that other places don‚Äôt"
"I wish Krispy Kreme gave the option to find specific donuts at different locations. For example, I love the sour cream donut and I drive to at least 5 different locations in South Florida to try and find it, and no luck. I hope a future update will address this issue."
"I‚Äôve been very happy using this app- always a convenience and it‚Äôs nice knowing I can earn freebies just for using it!  
You have a location in Brandon that was really convenient during Club volleyball season- our club team LOVES these donuts!"
"Horrible app.  When you order, you‚Äôre taken to the website to order outside of the app.

Then when you do order, you can order donuts the store doesn‚Äôt have available so you drive all the way there, just to be told you can either cancel the order or substitute other varieties you didn‚Äôt really want.   I don‚Äôt understand why this is even an app.  Terrible."
"I have used the app for a while now with no issue then when I finally get the free dozen I have to update so I update and now it can not find my account. I ask for a pin to reset my password I check my email then it goes back to the home screen. I have tried five different times, and the bad part is I know it is my correct password because it was protected by my thumb print. So frustrating!!"
I like the new design and everything but where is my points that was suppose to roll over once it was updated. What‚Äôs the point of having a app on our phone to gain points from our purchases and we lose our points from an simple update. Can you please give everyone there points back?
This is a great app and every so often they have free offers that only those with the app get to enjoy such as a free donut or other offers plus you can earn free food and drinks by using the app aside from this .
I collect points on every purchase. I have gotten several free dozen donuts with my points. And when the Carolina Panthers win I get points automatically added. The hot now light has always been accurate on my app.
i love Krispy Kreme but the way to get rewards could be more clear. The app is not buggy and the layout is very simple and basic. I like the feature where the viewer at home can see if the local Krispy Kreme has ready hot donuts. I would encourage any doughnut lover to get this app!
The app messes up whenever I use it at night. I normally use my phone to get donuts at night. Whenever I go to the scan page on my phone it automatically turns my brightness all the way up to max. I‚Äôve tried to see if it was just a glitch but it happens every time. I have an iPhone 8 Plus updated to the most recent iOS update. Please fix this guys. These phones get really bright and hurt my eyes bad.
"Being able to look at the menu and order online makes things so much easier. I babysit 3 kids at a time and when I order pizza it‚Äôs hard to pay attention to them or for whoever I talk to on the phone hear me. The app itself is organized and shows prices and coupons while you look through the menu. The food is also very good if you are one that gets full quickly. There is a huge selection of food to choose from and there is always a good coupon to use (my favorite is the 5.99 deal because the kids can get a pizza with 2 toppings they want. And then I can get either brownies for them or if I want a sandwich or salad instead of pizza I can get them- and it‚Äôs a short price considered what I could pay at other pizza places). Another thing that is beneficial is how I don‚Äôt have to stand by the door guessing the time they will be here. Instead they let me know when they left the store and the store is 10 min away so I know they will be here within 15 min. So I‚Äôll stay by the door for like 5 min instead of the whole 25-30 minutes. The app is very beneficial and helpful. So I def recommend this app, especially for my friends at a party or when babysitting"
"I love the food and the app is a great help but I wish there was an option for pasta/ bread bowls, pizzas, bread knots, wings, etc. to have the options of garlic or no garlic. I rarely get the bread bowls because I have a garlic intolerance I‚Äôm not allergic but it‚Äôs very very painful after eating it. I don‚Äôt like having to place an order only to realize too late I have to call the store and ask them not to. I don‚Äôt normally complain about anything with the food I really love it but it‚Äôs very awkward and inconvenient to have to call just to avoid a mishap. I feel really bad about it because a lot of the people that work at Dominos are really hard workers and the branch we order from are some of the most kindest, hardworking, genuinely care about the customers and take pride in doing things right. A lot of people who work in the food industry do care about their customers or their work of their job and I feel that a lot go under appreciated. Thank you for making the app to make it easier to order and thank you to the workers for all your hard work. Especially during the pandemic."
"I can imagine a few benefits from skipping out on building. Native app, but, it‚Äôs also all divided by a the cost of doing anything new, so I‚Äôm sure it makes less tsetse for profit people than product people. However, this app is garbage: even if the error codes have the exact same message as on the web (which isn‚Äôt hard for a native app to do). The hierarchy for actions is absurd. When I‚Äôm in the menu, I can‚Äôt see what‚Äôs in my cart, or my order totally until I‚Äôve added an item to the menu or closed the menu. Further, when you modify a pizza (I suppose it‚Äôs possible domino‚Äôs executives only eat the specialty pizzas) the price of the item you‚Äôre about to add to your order isn‚Äôt displayed. If you have 20 cash and want to maximize your pizza toppings, you might be adding something to the cart and removing it till you get it right for a long time, depending on user intelligence towards domino‚Äôs menu pricing. 

Bad app. It got an additional star because everything fit on screen and the branding was consistent with the average-at-best domino‚Äôs website. But that 2 should be compared with the 3 star‚Äôs missing for not valuing the user experience as an outcome of corporate value. 

(FYI, I couldn‚Äôt see the text as I was typing this, Apple that‚Äôs a problem u should look into. iPhone 6s Plus)"
"These ppl that made the pizza they be mean whenever you tell them you have it all the way burned order a pasta they talking about we don‚Äôt see you order pasta like dude sometimes your point don‚Äôt even show up on the system n I don‚Äôt care I just want my food cook right. I used to work at dominoes so I know ppl played around in there n the boss would like them then they look at the food n don‚Äôt want to admit they have it burnt 
You ask them to remake it n they get upset. I don‚Äôt know why  they don‚Äôt buy the products, they just make the stuff so we can order. Oh then the system they took money off my card it took me a whole month to get it back n everyone gave me a problem üòï I called up there 
‚ÄúMa‚Äôam I don‚Äôt see you order it didn‚Äôt pop up in the system‚Äù a girl with an attitude n I‚Äôm looking at my bank and I can clearly see they took my money took me an whole month cause they said I had to wait til I can get it back. So they have time where it just bad tbh it would be nice for corporate to actually answer the phone when I called or something they food good just this site in general isn‚Äôt"
"Am only giving this review because I was unable to place a delivery order from my favorite store. Usually I do carry outs but on this occasion I was unable to go out, so I had to use the delivery service. Thinking all was going as planned I calmly placed my order only to later discover some few seconds later my carry out store address on my profile was changed automatically. These seemingly did not sit well with me so I hurriedly tried to change the address back to my favorite stores address, only for me to find out that if you choose to use their (dominos) delivery service, you will automatically assigned the nearest store close to your location, this evidently infuriated me, because I have already gone to the store that was automatically assigned to my profile twice and I was not satisfied with how they make their pizza. Please if any of this app developers should see this, try to ensure you make it possible for people to order from their favorites stores in as much as they can pay for the delivery. The other reason which aided in my decision to award this app three stars is the lack of modern user interface. Am improvement in that area will be greatly appreciated."
"I‚Äôll tell you how; You want a delivery driver that‚Äôs willing to battle the unstable elements of blistering winds and sheer cold late at night against terrible drivers that impede their journey to deliver said treasure politely and elegantly at your door without breaking so much as a sweat to save your relationship when your significant other complains there‚Äôs nothing to eat since you couldn‚Äôt get the groceries and all the stores are closed? Yes you do. You DO want the blessings of humanity to ring your doorbell and support your relationship like Atlas holds up the world on his rippling shoulders all the while enjoying the very pizza you ordered in a cozy warm living room while the champions that brought upon a new form of nirvana accept your shillings and tip their cap looking over their shoulder dramatically in the night like Ryan Gosling in ‚ÄòDrive‚Äô; KNOWING FULL WELL that they are the real heroes and live a life of danger and unprecedented hazards that live on the edge like a 1970s action flick with unnecessary explosions because not all heroes wear capes but all heroes have a uniforms. I PROPOSE A TOAST! TO THE TRUE CHAMPIONS OF FLAVOR ! HUZZAH BRAVE WINNERS! HUZZAH!!
- A pleased Customer"
"I can‚Äôt believe a company would make it so hard to give them money. I spent over 30 mins or more trying to place an order on my iPad, where if you go to review your order you can‚Äôt go back and add anything else unless you want what they suggest, or you delete your whole order and start from scratch. That still wouldn‚Äôt have taken so long to place the order tho, but I was using a coupon they had, but my total was coming out way more than it should have. It took me a while to figure out that some crusts and toppings were causing my price to go up because they were more costly ingredients. The problem is no where on the list of ingredients does it let you know which ones cost extra and which don‚Äôt, it‚Äôs just one list of ingredients and if you choose ingredients based on the coupons guidelines and the price comes out to high then you are left confused as you get no information as to why. So after starting from scratch a few times since I can‚Äôt just go back to the main menu, I finally figured out what was raising the price so high. This app needs work, the ceo should try and use it, get to checkout and then try and go back to add something else and he‚Äôd quickly fire whoever made this app."
"This app is snappy, easy to use, and highly functional compared to other ‚Äúfast food‚Äù apps. The dev team did a great job. A couple suggestions for improvements: For carside pickups (mandatory in my neck of the woods during Covid), it would be nice if we had the option to have our car‚Äôs details (color, make, model etc) saved. I have to re-enter the details each time...not convenient. Same goes for delivery instructions...let us save them for next time. Rewards: they should be point-based for each dollar spent...not just 10 points for spending any amount over $10 points. $10 order? 10 points. $40 order: 10 points. What‚Äôs the incentive to order more?. If I‚Äôm spending $20, I should get 20 points, not 10. Now, I just create two orders if the pizzas are $11-12 each. Do whatever math you need to, to make rewards make sense, but don‚Äôt incentivize splitting orders up...it‚Äôs inconvenient for us and sometimes confusing for your staff. Also, a visual graph indicating our point standing would be nice."
"Now as I'm sure many of us know, Dominos used to have a rap for being ""cheap and inauthentic"" pizza. As someone who orders Dominos a lot, I agree, it was definitely nothing compared to now. In my past 12 orders, I have received extremely great customer service, expedition of delivery, great deals, and AMAZING food. I regularly tell people to order from them more, no matter what their opinion of what their last experience might've been. Dominos to me, is a leader and example of how a business should progress in the 21st century. Everything that Dominos has done in the recent decade has been a groundbreaking improvement for the company. I only order from Dominos and will continue to until the day I die. I love you Dominos. Thank-you.
Side note: the app is awesome. They keep you 100% updated the entire way through the order and very happy, friendly reminders from the employees when they're on their way and outside.

Update: I've probably made around 40-50 orders in the past year using the app. Absolutely still the best way to get the best pizza!"
"This app is deceptively convenient, it even has an ‚Äúorder tracker.‚Äù That is, until you realize that you have no idea if the location you‚Äôre ordering from is slammed or any sort of indicator of when your order will be ready/delivered (they just tell you when a milestone happens for your order, no timeframe for actually meeting those milestones). I have experienced multiple surprise 3+ hours waits using this app. And if the location you‚Äôre ordering from decides not to answer their phone (either because they‚Äôre just that busy or they don‚Äôt want to deal with what they assume will be an upset customer), like mine did tonight, you‚Äôll have no way to know how bad of a wait you‚Äôre in for without driving over in person (which feels excessive to me). I literally ordered at 7:33pm and it‚Äôs 11:22pm now, zero pizza to show. I don‚Äôt blame the people working there for being understaffed and overbooked, but I do blame the app for not giving an option for warning you if a place is slammed, or just not allowing past a certain number of orders. Even just changing it so that you can see what the milestone etas are could do a better job of stopping people from ordering when they clearly can‚Äôt deliver."
Every time we see an ad on TV from Dominos the toppings are amazingly an abundance on the pizza. And when I get my pizza I‚Äôll get maybe a handful of Topping! It‚Äôs pretty sad that you see more cheese than Topping. I know black olives come in a can. They can‚Äôt be that expensive just to throw a half a handful on them be generous! You know we all don‚Äôt just like cheese we want toppings pepperoni bacon sausage black olives onions peppers and etc. I‚Äôve gotten the pepperoni lovers. It looks just like a regular pepperoni pizza! So I feel like I‚Äôve been wasting money just ordering the specialty pizzas. If they don‚Äôt put enough toppings on it to even matter. So I save money by not even bothering to place the orders for the specialties. If you guys please could work on this I‚Äôd greatly appreciate it. I‚Äôve ordered pizzas throughout the years here and it‚Äôs only been a handful where they‚Äôve been really good. I‚Äôm not a picky person but when your boyfriend says don‚Äôt go back there. Did their pizza is not worth the price. It‚Äôs not a good sign when you order five pizzas in the more.
"We‚Äôve lived in the Lent‚Äôs area of Portland Oregon for the better part of about 40 years now. We‚Äôve ordered Dominos about once a month for the majority of the past about 10 years. Our home store is the one near Eastport Plaza. Until recently there‚Äôs always seemed to have been something wrong with our order; wrong order, wrong toppings, items missing (like bread bites or soda.) we‚Äôre ordering again tonight because the last couple of months we‚Äôve had incredibly great experiences! Nothing has been wrong and everything has been even better great! (I should also mention this is not only for delivery, but occasional carry out as well) Not sure if there‚Äôs a new manager, or a different crew (I do notice there‚Äôs usually someone training on something, so I‚Äôm guessing there may be a bit of quick turnover as is the case with most fast food type stores) Anyway! Whosever running things for the better there please keep on doing what you‚Äôre doing because it‚Äôs definitely working! Thanks"
"I order a A LOT of Domino‚Äôs, and part of the reason I‚Äôve remained loyal has been the rewards. With one of these recent updates however it has stopped crediting me entirely. I noticed last week that my reward points were lower than expected, but now after my most recent order and reviewing the orders I received credit for there are multiple missing. Furthermore there is no way to recover the rewards number & earn credit for these previous orders unless I have the physical box the pizza came in still in the fridge or trash, because I order & pay through the app, and I‚Äôm not emailed a rewards number with my receipt because I‚Äôm supposed to be signed-up and receiving those credits automatically. Luckily I was able to recover credit for one order this way, but the others appear to be irredeemable and there‚Äôs nowhere to look for more info. I‚Äôm very upset and disappointed, because I‚Äôve ordered Domino‚Äôs at least once a week for the last 5 years and  with my daughter and I order many many pizzas for the summer camp I manage every year. Having this happen multiple times over the last 4 weeks shows it‚Äôs systemic- whether a glitch or not-  and Dominos is going to lose my business going forward."
"I live in Seminole woods in Palm Coast, Florida. They are hands down THEE BEST IN THE STATE. And I never worked there, lol nor do I know anyone who does. But they are soooo clean. So efficient. Fast and prompt. Always courteous. I can‚Äôt say enough about them. I‚Äôm just glad they are in my delivery zone!!!! Hahahahah! P.S. tip ur drivers people. These guys u trust with ur food. So they trust u will help them make minimum wage with tips. I was surprised to find out tips are their primary income. They really don‚Äôt get an hourly wage. Again.....I‚Äôm a nurse. I‚Äôm not an owner of this restaurant and I honestly don‚Äôt know anyone who works there. I order frequently a few times a month but never caught names. It‚Äôs usually delivery. And always a different person at my house answering the door and a different delivery person. I just really feel credit should be given where it is deserved. They have never ceased to NOT impress me. And for me to leave a review is ....well let‚Äôs just say this was my first time.           üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç.   üëåüëåüëåüëåüëå.    üíØüíØüíØüíØüíØ  ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è"
"My last two deliveries was absolutely horrible. The app would say this person has left the store at this time but I wouldn‚Äôt get
My pizzas until an hour later when it‚Äôs in between warm and cold. Three months ago was the worst where it took them 3 hours to get my pizzas delivered in two separate deliveries...I don‚Äôt know why I couldn‚Äôt get them in one delivery when I only put in one order. On that note one of the pizzas was wrong. I complained only to feel like I was being shrugged off to an excuse of ‚Äú we‚Äôre really busy on saturdays‚Äù. If that is so then hire some more people to work Saturday‚Äôs and give me my pizza in a timely manner! On top of that not all pizzas are consistent with one another in taste and quality. The first time I had break sticks here, it was absolutely amazing! Then the last two times it was mediocre so I never get them anymore. Sometimes there‚Äôs just enough sauce which is amazing and then other times the sauce is overflowing the pizza as if I ordered extra extra sauce and then there are times where I have to question myself whether or not they forgot the sauce."
"I have not ordered Domino‚Äôs for years because the product was no better than grocery store frozen pizza. I needed a pepperoni pizza for kids, and I decided to order one of the new pan pizzas for me. When I picked up the pizzas and opened the first box, I was so surprised by the appearance of the product. It was smoking hot, the pepperoni was crisp and sizzling, and the hand tossed crust was blistered, crackly and perfectly, very slightly, charred. It was magnificent! 

I opened my pan pizza (sausage, jalape√±os, diced tomatoes, and onions). It was equally fantastic. A bit of the cheese, just the right amount, was all the way to the edges of the crust creating that yummy, chewy, crispy edge that is so addictive. 

Dominoes, I salute you. You figured out pizza is supposed to be amazing, and that is what you are selling now.  I am back; I‚Äôm a Dominoes customer and even a fan now. If you have not tried Dominoes lately, roll the dice. You can afford six dollars. That‚Äôs all it takes (with the coupon) to get a pizza. No other pizza company is providing the value Dominoes does at the moment."
"I was a customer years ago and the pizza quality and service was awful. Within the past two years of using this app, Domino‚Äôs has gained our family‚Äôs loyalty. We order weekly from them and sometimes when the weather is terrible. This app makes this working mom‚Äôs life so much easier. I can order from work, and not have to worry if they got the food or not. The app alerts you every step of the way in the ordering to the delivery. I can even order for a set delivery time to my office for our lunch meetings. If I am out of town and my family members need to order food they can just log on and pull up a previous order. 
The drivers are always on time and know how to navigate my family‚Äôs wild country driveway. They are awesome! The pizza, deserts, subs, and wings are always perfect. And don‚Äôt get me started on their prices... they exceed my expectations. If there is every anything missing or wrong, they make it double right. I would give them more than 5 stars if I could."
So online ordering was down i went through putting everything in my cart and when it came time to check out it wouldn‚Äôt load my total  but I know my total was 25 at the mostest. So anyway I‚Äôm forced to call the store I tell the girl my order she says total is 47 dollars and some change okay how did my order jump up like twenty dollars. I keep repeating at least three times my order and getting a great deal. She tells me no what did I want I tell her my Oder again and tell her I don‚Äôt want to pay anymore than 25 for my meal because my coupons totaled that. So she tells me just a medium one topping pizza will be 25 dollars I was going to order it but I said okay let me hang up cause she is really trying to milk me out of more money. I hang up go back to the app and try again and I get everything I initially wanted for geuss what ...24 dollars. I feel soo played but I still ordered my meal cause I‚Äôm hungry but definitely wanted to share my night with dominoes
"This is easily one of the most well coded ordering apps I‚Äôve seen on the App Store, everything is fluid and works well. It has an intuitive interface and is easy to use, my grandmother could probably use this without any trouble. However, there are a few things to be said about the tracker and gift card application. When I tried to checkout using my gift card, after verifying several times that the information I inputted was correct, the system would spit out an error that there was something wrong with my card. After doing 5-6 captchas I finally got it to work, and I was sent to complete my order. However after that, the pizza tracker was behaving rather erroneously, it would jump around and even move backwards from Delivery to Quality Check, this happened several times. Other then those two rather minor issues though, I had a very positive experience with this app! I‚Äôd recommend to anyone ordering from dominoes on mobile, very nice to use. Your app developers are doing their job well."
"I don‚Äôt understand why you cant pay cash on a carry out?  And since when because my app froze and lost its mind I couldn‚Äôt use my free pizza when I called the store and I was told he couldn‚Äôt find my account and that I got no points ZERO for the order I placed over the phone because I did not have the available funds on my card at the particular time.  The guy on the phone was rude about it and didn‚Äôt even offer an a apology. I order from dominoes a lot when I‚Äôm at home but I can tell you I won‚Äôt order from this location again. Absolutely no customer service or even a offer for assistance, and no points for my order on top of it all.  I am so so so very disappointed in this. It has really darkened my view of dominoes as a company not just this particular store.  I value customer service and friendliness as much if not more then the quality of the food. 

I really hope that upper management has the opportunity to review this, as a former member of a NPC management team I know only too well how quickly business and customers can slip away when not being valued and appreciated.  I would hate to see it happen to your company. Very quickly."
We are here on vacation and my grandkids wanted pizza. So I looked up the number to Dominos and I was moved 3 times to 2 different stores. I finally was upset after being moved around for 45 minutes. Spoke to a VERT RUDE worker who called herself a manager named Jessica. If she worked for me I would have to let her go as she didn‚Äôt care if I got pizza for my family. I then ask for her manager and was told very worker there was a manager except drivers. I was very upset because she told me she couldn‚Äôt and wouldn‚Äôt help me place my order. I needed to order online so they would know who‚Äôs store delivers to the hotel we are staying at. I own a business for 31 years and is a delivery company I would never speak or allow any of my workers to speak to my customers the way Jessica spoke to me. I will call her owner of that store tomorrow and have a few words with Manny as she told me that was her manager. I love the app so I never have to deal with a RUDE PERSON LIKE JESSICA AGAIN WHEN I AM ORDERING MY PIZZA.
"Pretty good app, I‚Äôve been eating domino‚Äôs for years in large part due to two reasons. 1. The pizza is actually pretty good for a mass chain. Lets face it, chain pizza is an abomination. Dominos has mostly avoided the bland taste and texture of the competitors since they reworked things back around 2010 IIRC about the date. A new CEO came to the helm as well I think.  2. This app. I started using it a number of years back and was quite pleasantly surprised at how good it worked for customization, coupons, tracking and payment. Most of the competition still doesnt have apps as good so kudos on that. Dominos must really be glad for this pre existing infrastructure when this pandemic hit. The app almost feels like it was made for just such a reality. I love that I can order a pie, have it contactless placed on my porch, grab it and reheat it for safety for a min or two and have a tasty meal like the pre zombie apocalypse days. My only app gripe is the ios version loses CC info if you double check your order but other than that I love it."
I love dominos I grew up on it just like with Pizza Hut but man I order dominos las week on Wednesday one of the worst experience ever the food was warm not hot and I live only 5-3 mins away I order a Caesar salad with a cup of ranch right ok finished ordering but the app crashed right then! So I call the store to check someone picks up I‚Äôm explaining i was so rudely cut off mid sentence he asks me my address I tell him he tells me yeah we got the order in and we don‚Äôt have the salad I was pressured to talk I said so let me have more wings I could of order another pizza but no I get my order home pizza it‚Äôs just barely warm the wings barely had any bbq when I orded a cup of extra bbq with the first order nop barely üëéüèª I never got the bbq I paid for I got blue cheese instead and the ranch that was for the salad that was supposed to be canceled with it and it‚Äôs so expensive I was extremely dissatisfied disappointed I didn‚Äôt called right away because I was hangry!!! üò§üò≠üò©üò°ü§®
"We ordered 2 pies (always thin crust) and as usual they were delivered promptly. After the delivery person left we noticed that one of the pies wasn‚Äôt the right crust (wasn‚Äôt thin crust) We called and they read the order back saying that only one of them was ordered with thin crust. We checked the app that we ordered it on and sure enough, THEY were correct. In spite of it being our mistake (we forgot to add thin crust) they immediately put the manager on the phone and he told us ‚Äúno problem, we will send another pizza out with thin crust at no charge!!‚Äù We told him that it was ok and not to go to any trouble... we will eat the pie because it was our mistake. He said ‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs no problem I see here in your history that you always get thin crust and are loyal customers, so keep the pizza that was sent and the thin crust is on the way‚Äù  
We were happily surprised and grateful! Way to go Domino‚Äôs! Thank you! That is customer service at its best!üëçüëç"
"I like this app and dominos of course there is a but.... But if you leave the app for any reason and comeback it will make you restart your order. Also it just depends on who your person is for your Oder to be contactless we order almost ever week for fun movie nights and it‚Äôs been interesting. You have to use your card then they make you sign the receipt. It makes since except we don‚Äôt have to sign recipts for any other delivery app (ubereats, DoorDash, etc). I think I had one who placed our pizza on a stand on the ground then rang the bell we opened the door they were on the way to the car. One placed it straight on the ground and stood back. The others handed it to us (not contactless at all) one even handed me a card for his lawn care business. Some came with mask some did not. Obviously I‚Äôm not to upset cause I keep ordering just being informative. But maybe there should be some training on contactless and a change in the signing of the recipients maybe an online version."
Made to order pizza but cut uneven. I received my last pizza with both big slices and baby sized slices. How can you share a pizza cut like that when most people in your family will grab the biggest slices? You know exactly how I feel because either you are the person who wants the biggest slices or you have at least once got stuck with the smallest slice in the box. If I were a secret pizza shopper points would have definitely been taken off for my last pizza. It‚Äôs not rocket science literally cut it in half one way and then half the other way and all that is left is cutting those 4 slices in half again. The only explanation for this is the employee manning the oven is in too much of a rush. A great pizza is a work of art so also please stop dumping the pineapple just in one spot on the pizza- you‚Äôre driving my OCD crazy. I know that some people think oh it‚Äôs just pizza but I am sure that the founder of Domino‚Äôs would disagree like I do.
"The app is really easy to use when looking at menu items and getting what you want in the cart. Paying is a different story. It took me three times to add my credit card information before the app accepted it. Kept getting a message that I had no payment method chosen. And, there is no way to add a tip to the total. Message says to add a tip when the driver gets my signature. ??? This is supposed to be a contactless delivery, so this makes no sense! My other pet peeve is that the app always asks me to re-enter my password. I get that this is a security measure, but why does the app not allow for fingerprint or facial recognition instead of making me go find my password and type it in? The font is also TOO LARGE, and the app will only operate in landscape mode, so this means that scrolling through rewards history gets cut off at the bottom of the screen. I would really like to know if the programmers ever use their own app. If they did, these problems would have been fixed by now."
"I‚Äôve been having more deliveries in the era of COVID-19 and it‚Äôs been cautious. No contact delivery which I very much appreciate. The food is delicious. The service is great. The Dominos Tracker is a neat thing to keep me updated with my order. 

I can only say an issue I have with this is with the delivery update. It‚Äôs not as accurate as I‚Äôd hope it would be for the Dominos Tracker and that‚Äôs a bit of a let down. The last two times, I was waiting for my pizza and got no notification but checked to see if I could see the driver coming because it said my pizza would be arriving in 10 minutes but it was already there.

I don‚Äôt know how long it was outside for. And then 10 minutes later, I got the notification that my pizza had been delivered - this was while I was already eating it. So I‚Äôm a bit more vigilant about my orders but the updates weren‚Äôt accurate which is bothersome."
"First - this app is really intuitive and easy to use in comparison to others I‚Äôve used.  
Second, I was in the store the last time I ordered and waited for my meal.  It was incredibly busy.  The owner or manager was there working right along with his employees.  It was impressive to see him keep an eye on every moving piece and help those that were struggling.  I noticed that he moved a few people around to different stations, so I was assuming he really knows his employees and what they do well.  The drivers would come in for more orders and he was making sure everything was going well for them. The store had a handful waiting, and he‚Äôd keep having his workers check for our order.  He was also motivating them to keep moving.  He said to them ‚Äúif you stop moving or slow down, we are going to get way behind.‚Äù  He was so nice but yet being great at keeping them on pace.  
He seems like a great manager for these high school students."
"I go back and forth between Domino‚Äôs Pizza And the hut. To tell you the truth I don‚Äôt even know why I bother with the other guys. They are always forgetting my drinks or some other thing saying we were out but we will give you a credit for your next order. Those credits must be imaginary. Well you guys were out of the two liters but the girl brought me 3 of the 20 ounce bottles and I think that was AWESOME. She wins a gold star!  In fact because you guys were capable of making the substitution I have decided to delete those other guys app off my phone. I hate getting stuck eating pizza with plain water or having to go out and buy soda because that totally defeats the purpose of having food delivered. If I wanted to get out I would have ordered for pick up. I am very happy with the easy use if your app, the speedy service of your delivery and the 3 twenty ounce bottles of soda that were subbed for the 2 liter!"
"If you change the location after loading the cart and then use the easy reorder button it will place the order to the original location not the one you just tried changing it to and not warn you so your pizza will be one place and you another. Then when you arrive to pickup they‚Äôll tell you it‚Äôll be ready in 10. You‚Äôll wait 20 they‚Äôll finally figure out your pizza is across town. You‚Äôll reorder and pay a second time at the Carryout location and you‚Äôll call the store across town to try to cancel your wrong order. You‚Äôll then sit on hold for 15 minutes and the manager well then call you a liar, say ‚Äúwell you should be more careful next time ordering online‚Äù and then he‚Äôll hang up on you. That‚Äôs all he‚Äôll say that‚Äôs it and then he‚Äôll freaking hang up on you. You‚Äôll walk out totally astounded totally forgetting you ever wanted pizza in the first place. Five stars for Dominies new weight loss program. I‚Äôm actually cured of pizza cravings now for like several months. But Dominies, your service and app have major glitches. Oh and I‚Äôm selling all my Dominies stock at market open on Monday. It‚Äôs my way of hanging up on you. You can keep my $18."
"I applaud Dominos for their various creative methods of gaining ground in the real estate of pizza delivery in   ways that are innovative and based on classic customer service. I'm glad their app delivers these features in a clear and accessible layout without hype or confusing technical issues.

They let you earn free points for pizza you buy from anyone (direct approach to market research rewards). 

They throw up 'pizza hotspots' for deliveries because now a days people aren't always stationary.

They insure carry out orders against just about anything.

The Domino's Tracker, which is a trademarked progress bar for your pizza order, gives you realtime info that helps to know that you're being taken care of. 

And I learned all the above while placing an order. 

The app is quick to use and does have lots of 'save this...' checkboxes for your orders, locations, etc. which are, at first a little visually overwhelming but is well explained and makes a ton a sense to save time. 

I don't keep many restaurant apps on my phone because they usually abuse the few bucks they save you to see you as a spam bucket, but the dominos app has been great. 

The only feature I feel is missing is a rough ETA on the final Tracker page - however I'm sure some people get too edgy about the exact time. The estimated time is shown at the final ordering screen.

Keep up the great dev work!"
"I was a hardcore Pi*za H*t fan for a number of years as it was all that was offered in my hometown.  They were outrageously priced and didn‚Äôt deliver to my home, but it was pizza and it was what I thought was good.  When I moved to the ‚Äòbig city‚Äô I finally learned what pizza-making and delivery is supposed to taste like.  Domino‚Äôs has an insane menu and I was a bit overwhelmed at first because as a child because then it was just simple pepperoni and cheese.  They have SO MANY options and pairings I‚Äôd love to know just how many combinations there are.  On top of being able to get so many different types of pie, there‚Äôs additional delicious food to choose from.  Then the best part‚Äî the Tracker.  It‚Äôs the coolest thing ever.  I love being able to check and see where my pizza is in the store and knowing who‚Äôs doing an amazing job at it.  The delivery is quick and painless and I love all the drivers.  Most importantly, I love you Domino‚Äôs, you‚Äôre so good to me."
"NO PUN INTENDED BUT ITS TRUE, the pie is the overall final item that we as customers ultimately rate and feel the most emotion and feedback, whether satisfying good or bad, in this case being GREAT,  when digesting and giving a report card or review/rating.   I AM ON MY FOURTH FREEBEE PIZZA in the last 24 months, MEANING,  I‚Äôve ordered over 24 different times in said period of time so let the facts speak for itself. I‚Äôm a picky New York native grubbing pizza freak and I can handle an attitude or a lack of knowledge with a pizza boy over a telephone call, so really, it‚Äôs our faults as customers to get an order wrong or have a receipt go missing or not ask for enough napkins or Parmesan on the side. It‚Äôs our fault for not using the telephone free,  person-free, emotionless and very direct to the point beyond any clarifying Lehman‚Äôs terminology. Be direct people. Order online.  Don‚Äôt forget to ask. Have a Pizza day!"
"To the developers: First off, I do like using the app and I prefer it to ordering over the phone. That being said, there are a couple of things I‚Äôd like changed. I can‚Äôt delete an expired credit card that is saved in the app. It always tells me the process failed and to try again later. Second, the app used to show the amount saved at checkout. This was great because you could see the savings totaled up, right next to the bill. When Domino‚Äôs still had the  coupon for $5 on 1-topping medium pizzas and wings, I could save almost 50%. It seems that the current programming registers which items were discounted by marking the item price in red. Therefore, the total is the discounted price. I wasn‚Äôt sure if my coupon had actually worked, so I had to call the store to check. This is a waste of time for me and the store. Please go back to displaying the amount saved. Thank you."
"I understand times are tough, more for some than others yeah. But lately the service from domino‚Äôs hasn‚Äôt been the best nor the same, it was our favorite! From humans to the web page and app it has been horrible experiences. I haven‚Äôt been able to place an order online, app nor redeem my rewards... for the second time in aprx. less 2 weeks. I call the store just like the website or app suggest I do and the person on the other side states there‚Äôs nothing they can do. Yet they‚Äôre the locations I buy my pizzas and wings from. Purchased the pizza and wings anyway without the redemption of points. Had to place it over the phone due to the ‚Äúsystem not working‚Äù, give my card over the phone and then not be given my food, nice and hot out the oven but an hour later with attitude when we walked in to ask for it although we arrived at most 10minutes after the order was made and payed for. Had to microwave food that is supposed to be given hot with kindness. Rewards that are unredeemable also not a fan of. Often I spend more just to me your criteria for earning those points!"
"As long as you don‚Äôt have a bad experience everything can  be good. Except for small things every now and then. Soon as there starts being issues and you‚Äôre spending money on food that isn‚Äôt they way you want it or you can‚Äôt even tell them how you want it because they get a bad manager in your area that won‚Äôt answer the phone unless it‚Äôs to pick up and hang up when you haven‚Äôt even called prior. This had never been a problem until Dora Alabama branch hired this bad manager. I have screen shots of phone calls to this branch being on hold without to take the phone call to make a order for over 29 minutes. The reason it wasn‚Äôt longer I hung up after driving to the store only to have him be rude before I could even get one word out. 
I reported this and I never heard back from them. The only other option if I wasn‚Äôt satisfied was to contact the branch I had a problem with. I already tried that. I won‚Äôt continue to purchase food there that I pay for and can not get it how I want it because the manager is to busy and rude to answer the phone."
"Hire better developers. It crashes and crashes and crashes and now I don‚Äôt even know if Dominos even took my money or if my order is on the way or not. I can‚Äôt open the app or reinstall it to restart it from the beginning because it crashed at checkout amongst all the other previous crashes making me have to change my location and refill my cart several times, I couldn‚Äôt believe I finally got so far as the checkout screen, then you didn‚Äôt even give me an option in the GUI to add a tip so now I have to figure out how to pay a cash tip to your driver. I‚Äôll walk to an atm somewhere nearby, hopefully they can break a 20. You just keep crashing and won‚Äôt let me start over. Garbage. Apps don‚Äôt crash this consistently and in this many different places in the app with decent, experienced, and skilled developers working on it. Millennials now get a 2 year computer programming degree or teach themselves Swift over the summer and all of a sudden they think they can and want to build apps for multi million dollar corporations. Dominos needs to rebuild the app and possibly something on their servers."
"Not often than not I end up having to call. Either the order won‚Äôt go through or the app won‚Äôt support a change I want to make. I usually get the chicken bacon ranch sandwich and ad mushrooms. It‚Äôs entirely impossible to make changes to sandwiches on the app, not possible to add or remove anything. It doesn‚Äôt want to connect to my rewards account so that I earn points, when it is actually functioning, or I don‚Äôt want an unsupported change to an item. I haven‚Äôt even used the app in months. Decided, after a stressful day of work, to relax and order in. I told my boyfriend to call Domino‚Äôs. He asks me why I don‚Äôt just use the app... So I opened it and remembered immediately why I haven‚Äôt used it in so long. Legitimately, I was so frustrated that we decided to just do something else for dinner. Think I‚Äôll just delete at this point. The only really good thing about the app, when it works for my needs, is that you can see by the minute what‚Äôs happening to your order. That‚Äôs the only reason this is a two star and not a one star review."
"I love this app for dominos. It just feels so much better to use than the website, which sometimes gets errors. I order pizza essentially every week and I never use this app for one simple reason. You can‚Äôt tip through the app. That‚Äôs literally the only reason why this isn‚Äôt 5 stars. Despite this being better than the website, I almost never use it. I‚Äôve tried multiple times and can‚Äôt figure out a way to be able to tip the delivery driver through the app, so I only use the app when I order for pickup. I love dominos food and I love this app, and maybe it could use some updates to make the font and user interface a bit cleaner and more modern, but I would definitely use this app over the website if I could just tip through it. It‚Äôs an amazing app that they did a great job on, they just haven‚Äôt updated it with this crucial feature that‚Äôs on the website, at least to my knowledge."
"Every time I order from this dominos I have good customer service,,  they r very nice always polite n respectful.. my orders are always ready at the time they say it will be ready.. even there was one time that it took an extra half an hour for my food to be ready and they gave me my order for free.. soo all in all this is the onli dominos that I come to,, n I‚Äôm a repeat customer not onli me from my household but also my sister orders allot from here too.. so thank u to the whole dominos crew for making my order on point every time,, n even if they don‚Äôt they always fix it without me asking for them to fix the problem.. so again thank u for the great customer service,and making me feel comfortable they r never rude or disrespectful , and it makes me wanna join there team.. I‚Äôm actually waiting to talk to the manager now to talk bout a job.. ü§©"
"This app has gotten better over the time I‚Äôve been using it(for some years), but there is an issue I would like to bring to the light. You all have advertisements on deals for 5.99 each for medium one topping pizzas, for example, but when I go to the deals menu sometimes the prices for said deals aren‚Äôt even shown. So after I select my items and go to the checkout, it‚Äôs regular priced! Something is definitely not right about that. Please fix this problem because I don‚Äôt want to be advertised something and when I place an order I have to pay regular price. This isn‚Äôt the only time it happened. 

I was in quarantine and had to order from y‚Äôall. I mean I like your pizza...so I believe it was a deal for two large pizzas for a certain price each. I don‚Äôt remember the price but I paid the amount shown and it was the regular price. I was desperate anyway so I paid for it but I was very much frustrated with that."
"I think the app is great‚Ä¶.however‚Ä¶the only reason I am giving it 4‚≠êÔ∏è‚Äôs is because the app for the Mini IPad does not have an option to tip.  I would really like to know as to why that is. It is frustrating having I switch devices to start the order process all over so that we can provide a tip to the delivery associate. I don‚Äôt always have cash on hand‚Ä¶as most people don‚Äôt now a days. Sometimes I have to call the store and have them charge my card. Come-on Domino‚Äôs‚Ä¶..I believe the company should at least make that option available to the hard working delivery associates. I believe the associates are missing out on a lot of money because of that. With no fault of their own. I really do hope you look into  that. 

Delivery associates‚Ä¶keep up the good work! You have my respect for putting yourself on the line during this horrible pandemic. Wishing you many blessings! Happy Holidays to all!"
"We all know that a useful, easy to navigate, seamless app isn‚Äôt the only thing we should appreciate. It also comes down to the employee on the other end of that application. The fact that every domino‚Äôs employee that has ever delivered to my house has use the location services provided is absolutely phenomenal. OTHER pizza apps have the same features but seem to fail and using them at more than half the time (my personal experience) to report anything past the cooking stage. I‚Äôm not sure why but I find it very useful to see when my pizza leaves the store and is on the way to me. The only thing I could ask for is to have one of those special delivery vehiclesI see on the internet here at my local dominos. Thanks again to everyone on board and keep being awesome."
"Working night shift I have limited choices for ‚Äúlunch‚Äù.  I love that this store delivers later than most, the food and service is always great. The new drivers seem to struggle to find our unit entrances and we are a small campus so my only suggestion would be to maybe pay attention the first time and/or to the special directions provided as most of us try to spell out our location on campus, it is very inconvenient to leave our floor to meet a driver, that‚Äôs why we order delivery. There are only two places to enter after 10pm so it should be simple to figure that out. Maybe come drive around during the daylight hours and get more familiar with the situation. Like I said, the drivers and staff are always friendly and I have zero complaints, just a suggestion to improve service to our particular site. We eat a lot of pizza! Lol."
"I ordered a large Brooklyn style pizza for delivery last week.  True, I placed the order around 10:30pm and it arrived a little past 11pm.  What bothered me was that it was delivered in ‚Äúthe special truck‚Äù but it was cold, and it looked like something weighted down the center of the pizza box because the cheese, peppers and onions were stuck to the top of the box.  I was able to reheat it (over reheated it a bit unfortunately) but I haven‚Äôt had pizza (cheese) in almost three years and I liked the option for 1/2 the amount of cheese, but since it‚Äôs been so long that I‚Äôve eaten pizza I was disappointed with the quality and presentation.  Maybe because it was late?  I thought that domino‚Äôs had special pouches and warming devices on their trucks, but they didn‚Äôt even use that three legged little plastic device that protects the pizza from making contact with the pizza box cover.  It was obvious that no love was put into this pizza, and it‚Äôs always disappointing when you place a delivery order and the quality isn‚Äôt consistent."
"I tried to order something about an hour before close, and they canceled my order. I didn‚Äôt receive a call about it so I tried to call and they hung up the phone 3 times rather than answering. I was going to be polite and ask why they canceled my order. The 4th time I called, yes I was being that petty, the lady answered and I asked why my order was canceled. She said they were closing early because they ran out of food. Doubtful, but whatever. Then I said that in the future they should call when they cancel an order, because they never do (yes this has happened more than once). Then she told me they did. I never received a call and if they did call, why would they end my first 3 calls? This company clearly doesn‚Äôt take the time to train their employees on basic customer service, or common courtesy, and I‚Äôm beyond disappointed that this keeps happening. It‚Äôs obviously just about the bottom line and not the customers. I hate being this person and putting only one star, but this ridiculous and I‚Äôm done with this company‚Äôs crap."
"Not even mad that Domino‚Äôs is the only pizza place that delivers to my house. The app makes me want to be the one to order when somebody wants pizza because I gotta get those pieces any chance I get. My friends can Venmo me the money for their pizza as long as I get my free pie reward. The access to coupons is simply amazing, there‚Äôs always a deal on something delicious that everybody wants.
My one and only problem is that there is no estimated delivery time. I only live 5 minutes from a Domino‚Äôs, and as helpful as it is to know when my driver left the store, it would be even nicer to know if it‚Äôs going to be 15 minutes between my order being completed and a hot pizza in my hand or 45 minutes because the store is slammed or my driver is making multiple stops.
As long as I get my piece of the pie rewards, Domino‚Äôs will have a piece of my heart. I üçï U 4ever Domino‚Äôs."
"Not only do they not have a direct number to any sort of customer service line, but they also don‚Äôt say anywhere that if you pay through the app that you will have to give them your ID for payment. So, after leaving the note on the order ‚Äúdon‚Äôt knock, leave at door‚Äù, they cancelled my order. And I can‚Äôt answer the door because of severe anxiety. Oh, and that‚Äôs not all, because my ex used to be the one to have his phone number listed, and answer the door, due to my severe anxiety, they didn‚Äôt call me to tell me they cancelled the order. Nope. I had to call the store, another incredibly difficult thing for me to do, and find out they not only cancelled my order but called my ex as well. You‚Äôd think that‚Äôd be everything but nope. I ordered it using points so I only had to pay for the delivery charge and those weren‚Äôt reimbursed. When I called the store I got some snotty girl too who was all ‚Äúyou can reorder but yeah we had to cancel your original one‚Äù. The only decent pizza place that delivers, and I don‚Äôt ever want to order from them again. Thanks for nothing."
"It seems as though The Dominos location that my order defaults to is unable to handle the orders that are placed. I‚Äôve given the app and my local Dominos quite a few chances. Each time, the app estimates 20-30 minutes for delivery, yet my pizza takes well over an hour to arrive. The app will also ‚Äútrack‚Äù my order, but will tell me that my order has been delivered long before my order has even left the store. There are other locations nearby, but I have yet to locate an ability in the app to select my location of choice. I would appreciate the ability to choose my store since my ‚Äúneighborhood Dominos‚Äù cannot keep up with demand. The associates are also no help and are very quick to answer a phone call with ‚Äúyour order has already left the store‚Äù (with no estimated time known ) after I‚Äôve already spent 90 minutes waiting on one pie that I was quoted 30 minutes for.

Please, make your tracker accurate, and if it doesn‚Äôt already exist, add the function to choose your store location."
"I loved pizza from moment I first ate it as a kid‚Ä¶but then again who doesn‚Äôt like this salty pie?!! But pizza from Dominos? Nah‚Ä¶.not for me. Pizza Hut was where it was at. The Hut was synonymous in my mind with pizza. But then things changed, well actually Dominos changed. I noticed the new logo, wasn‚Äôt impressed‚Ä¶.still same old pizza no one goes to. But I WAS WRONG!!! My wife and I were wanting pizza one night and a Dominos was closer to the house. My wife suggested it, I gave in, and I didn‚Äôt look back. You guys not only changed your logo, but changed your whole vibe, but more importantly you changed your pizza swag. Whatever you have done to your pizza, in my humble opinion, it blows away any other pizza out of the water. You guys went from irrelevant to relevant real quick. Oh, and this app is top notch too!!! Enjoy Dominos, I‚Äôm hooked!!"
Pretty good experience. Rewards is good but a modification to it like double the rewards during football Sunday would amp the sales up. Person who continue to order during Football days usually buy a decent amount of pizza. Being rewarded double or an extra for a purchase limit ie($25 or more) during Sunday should give you an extra 10points or something. To be honest if Pizza Hut delivered in my area it would be tough competition being that they have the same deal. If you want to demolish Pizza Hut into the ground then you have to adapt to the changing factors like they did. They seem that Dominoes was getting more order due to a dollar difference in their pizza deal from 6.99 for each product of select items to dominoes deal of 5.99. Hopefully some reads the review and thinks about cashing in on promotions with potential partners like NFL. Especially during breast cancer awareness month.
"I always have an amazing experience every time I order dominoes pizza; which is every week! Not only is the food always on point and cooked exactly to perfection, but the staff and employees are always so personable and go above and beyond to make sure we get the best experience possible! I also want to commend this company on giving EVERYONE a chance to work with them; we have had the pleasure of having our pizzas delivered by a super sweet awesome deaf woman. She did her very best and is always great to see! It truly makes my heart warm when she makes our delivery. The Satellite Beach FL location has been my go-to location for 8+ years and I am so grateful for each and everyone that takes their time making our meals. Thank you dominoes for doing what you do best... making delicious pizza and hiring the BEST employees!!!! 

-Olivia Cohen"
"So tonight I went to the joker. It was a pretty good movie I‚Äôll give it a 7.5. Afterwords came back to my house with my buddies and my wife, she‚Äôs in the basement watching our TV show without me. #Bummer
So me my buddies end up sitting in the kitchen we‚Äôre drinking bourbon and we think to ourselves dang we‚Äôre hungry. So what‚Äôs the next logical step either we‚Äôre making a cr√®me br√ªl√©e or we‚Äôre ordering a pizza. Guess what guys, we ordered a pizza on this fantastic app! 
Needless to say if your wife is ever watching the show that you‚Äôve been wanting to watch with her without you and you end up in the kitchen hungry as could be drinking bourbon with your buddies, this is the app for you because the pizza from Domino‚Äôs pizza is the best. The best in the west or in this case the Midwest. #htown #kansas #werethethreebestfriends #pizzahutsuck #lactoseintolerance #shouldwehavetippedmore #beansfodayz"
"Joanie is so good to my daughter! We of course are regular customers but we are because of the way she manages this store. In fact the entire staff is great but I would guess it‚Äôs because she leads by example. She always goes the extra mile and for even the simplest order there‚Äôs something extra or special put into the transaction. 

She noticed my daughter and complimented her behavior once and afterward my daughter just came to love her, we both do and live the store. We won‚Äôt get pizza anywhere else. 

An example of the extra effort she puts into things is like for my daughter‚Äôs birthday I ordered I guess around 20 pizzas. When we got to the party every single box had a special birthday wish to my daughter. All unique and all extremely thoughtful. 

I can‚Äôt say enough good things and I‚Äôd like to be clear that we only came to know her through doing business at this store so it‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre friends outside the store or neighbors.

Another example is once I made a comment that my daughter didn‚Äôt feel well and when we got home there was a special message for my daughter again from Joanie.

She‚Äôs the best and deserves far more accolades than I could ever write here.

Please treat her well and commend her and her store!

Thank you,
Louie & Irelyn Conner (daddy & daughter)"
"This app makes no sense. They made it to be dynamic and nice to look at, but in doing so, they circumvented their primary goal of making it easy to order their food. I found many examples of this in the 10 minutes it took to order a pizza - the coupons slide across the screen with no warning, the text is far too small and has poor contrast (so you can‚Äôt read it), the lists of toppings should be visible at all times (like on a normal paper menu) without having to scroll, the sauces add-ons for the breadsticks and wings are not set against a contrasting background (so you can‚Äôt see them), the sub menus are infuriating... I could go on and on. Then when I was finally ready to check out, I entered my card info and could not click the ‚Äòcontinue‚Äô button! By the end of my app experience, I was so hungry that I just clicked cash because I honestly just wanted to be finished with this app.

Maybe the real purpose of the app is to make you so frustrated that you want to use your phone to call and talk to an actual person..."
"I order pretty often and I have never had a bad experience. One time they forgot my sauces which really wasn‚Äôt that big of a deal. Food is always delicious. Drivers always friendly. Almost always super quick. The app is great. Super easy to navigate and use. Never have had any network issues or anything of that sort. Love the different features that make ordering online easy and efficient. Not to mention just feeling comfortable with the fact that you know you‚Äôre getting what you paid for, having it delivered by a friendly and well kept/ clean person, it will be quick, and the most important, knowing that in the rare occasion that there is a mistake, you will be taken care of no questions asked. Oh can‚Äôt forget the tracker. Gotta love the tracker. Honestly, hands down, BEST FEATURE."
"For the last few years, on an almost weekly basis, I‚Äôve ordered pizza delivery from Dominos for the family. Each time I pay an additional $1.50 for ranch dressing PACKETS. I buy the packets over the cups, paying the extra $1.00 fee for each, because they are Ken‚Äôs ranch dressing, which everyone prefers. This worked fine while I lived in Dallas. However, since moving to Fort Lauderdale, I‚Äôve received the packets maybe twice. Each time the driver apologizes for the mistake, tells me the packets ‚Äúare for salads,‚Äù or offers to return to the store and deliver later (once the pizza is cold and/or already eaten). Occasionally, they‚Äôll offer to refund my money, which NEVER happens. I‚Äôve spent several hours on the phone waiting to speak to a manager about this issue and even filed formal complaints with corporate to no avail. I estimate Dominos has stolen over $50 of my hard earned money by not delivering my order correctly or refunding my undelivered items. Thus, my two star rating for decent pizza, but horrible customer service!"
"I‚Äôm upset with the app and reordering from my previous orders or ‚Äúfavs.‚Äù I ordered from a previous order using the app and when I went to place the order it changed my pizza‚Äôs from what I selected to two sausage and pepperoni pizza‚Äôs. Absolutely ridiculous that this is even an option when it changes it on you. Looked at my receipt and it said two sausage and pepperoni pizzas when I know for a fact I selected from my ‚Äúorder history‚Äù to ‚Äúreorder.‚Äù Tried to use the app to see if I messed up and when I went to reorder again I watched it automatically change my pizza‚Äôs again. So I couldn‚Äôt even take the pizzas back in to tel them my order was wrong because it wasn‚Äôt according to the app and receipt. This is the second time this has happened, but the first time I didn‚Äôt notice. I just assumed they gave me the wrong pizza because I didn‚Äôt realize until I got all the way home and didn‚Äôt want to take them back. Would not recommend using the app it‚Äôs ridiculous and garbage."
"I don‚Äôt want anyone to get me wrong I loved dominos and the food is always amazing but I have a lot against their customer services it‚Äôs pure crap I can‚Äôt stand it I‚Äôm talking about the one in Lincoln Nebraska.... at first the food was getting prepared for over 45 minutes and then I call them to ask what was going on and she picked up the phone with a rude manner and telling me that the road was bad so the drivers we‚Äôre getting late which I understand but why would you be rude and mean about it ? Like come on I‚Äôm a human being I can empathize if you explain me something but it doesn‚Äôt end there after hearing how my tone started to change she offers to give me free pizza and then hang up on me like I was a beggar. Just saying agreeing on reviewing a free pizza because they offer it doesn‚Äôt show nor mean that I‚Äôm a beggar and can‚Äôt afford a single pizza.... 
I‚Äôm really dedicated to not buy a single thing from dominos till I die. 
I never felt like a beggar my whole entire life.
Ps: not everyone who accepts free pizza are beggar nor try to gain something from a 14$ pizza."
"It accomplishes its purpose. Good app overall.

The first request I have is that you add Apple Pay support to the app. I am not going to save my credit card info with every merchant with whom I make a purchase (including Domino‚Äôs), and it‚Äôs inconvenient to have to type it every time. Plus, Apple Pay is more secure. If not this, then please add the ability to auto-fill my credit card information that‚Äôs saved in Safari (iCloud Keychain).

Next, the app should have configurable notification settings. I enabled notifications so that I can be notified about orders I place. The app subsequently sent me spam notifications about deals they have. Please add granular controls so we can disable notifications about specific things like deals. I had to disable notifications completely in the meantime."
"This app is great! If it be that I‚Äôm using it on my iPhone, iPad or getting updates via my Apple Watch. I love the flexibility and functionality of being to just reorder what I order last time and how my rewards are always suggested.

However even though you have a great app your amazing store team at the Crossroads TX location is why we keep coming back. They know my family and I by first name, they pull the pizza off the shelf and having it waiting as we walk-in the door and they always check to make sure our pizza is right. There was one time where the pizza wasn‚Äôt to par and they already had it re-made and it was coming out of the oven as we were walking in. I might have had to wait 2-3 extra minutes but getting that type of customer service is why we love Dominos."
"I‚Äôll get this out of the way first, it looks great and is fairly intuitive. I never felt lost in the app, even if the coupons are a bit harder to look up than they need to be. However, like everything Dominoes does, it can be a bit finicky at times when your password ceases to work (happened on computer and app login twice now) or your points magically vanish for a few minutes at a time. I will say that these issues are largely on the server side rather than the app side, and have not caused any significant problems since my points have always been logged regardless of any lookup issues. Overall I give it 4/5 because issues did happen, but I never felt like it was the apps fault. (For example my VPN was giving it problems till I switched servers so my issues may have been there)"
"The app is fine. The pizza is decent, but the service is pathetic. I will no longer order from a place that is unable to read simple instructions. They charge you for sauces that they never bring even though they should be double checking their orders before the driver takes off for delivery. I even write in the special notes section ‚Äúdouble check the order for accuracy‚Äú. The manager says it‚Äôs the driver‚Äôs responsibility to double check the order and the driver claims it‚Äôs the cashier‚Äôs responsibility to double check the order, but all I know is that I‚Äôm the customer and it‚Äôs not my responsibility to make sure they got my order correct.  
I‚Äôm deleting the app because I‚Äôm no longer spending money with these morons that cannot follow simple instructions.
Collecting money on an order that was not for filled is basically theft. The support they give to the NFL is also another fine reason I‚Äôm looking forward to no longer spending any money with them, if you don‚Äôt like this country get the out and go wherever you think is better."
"Editing my order took me back to the ingredients list and it wasn‚Äôt possible to scroll all the way through the non-meat items. I could scroll up to see the next items in the list but as soon as I raised my finger off the screen the list scrolled back up to the top and only showed the first few items. I couldn‚Äôt make any choices from the ingredients list below the place where it was stuck. Had to delete and restart the pizza. Also, I was prompted on the order page to re-enter the payment info I had just entered on the previous screen while I looked for a place to tip the delivery person (which I never found). Also it‚Äôs just a bit too slow. The slightest tweak to a topping leads the app to spend 5 to 10 seconds recalibrating or recalculating. That adds up when you‚Äôre deciding exactly which toppings you want it‚Äôs just too slow."
"Since the tip feature was put back in I added a star back since last time I rated.

The app is quite handy for ordering pizzas, however there are a couple things I would very much like to see changed. Please stop making use do captchas with gift cards. It makes no logical sense. Even if it‚Äôs a robot paying for the pizza, it‚Äôs still being PAID for. Those things are super annoying. Also it would be nice to save the gift card to the account so we don‚Äôt need to type it in each time. Lastly, please save whether I am getting delivery or pickup, or ask me each time when I choose reorder. I‚Äôve accidentally checked out without changing it a couple times and didn‚Äôt realize it till the store called to see if I was coming. I sometimes forget it doesn‚Äôt remember my choice for that.

Other than that I like the app when I get my pizza cravings :)"
"I love this app, and dominos, and especially my local dominos. Easy ordering, A+. Two things would be super helpful, though. It would be nice to be able to see the price of items before you add them, and as you go, like how much am I raising the price of this pizza by adding additional toppings. The biggest problem is there doesn‚Äôt seem to be any option to add a tip when you pay with a card, not at checkout, nor on a receipt when the pizza arrives. I‚Äôm sure this issue leaves a lot of drivers tipless, and that is a massive bummer. If I didn‚Äôt think about this, and it was one of the many days I don‚Äôt have any cash on me, idk I‚Äôd feel awful and have to offer my pal some candy, a back rub, something. Y‚Äôall don‚Äôt want me down at the store trying to insist they let me help mop. Too many people don‚Äôt tip properly as it is. It‚Äôs so sad, please don‚Äôt make it easy for the non-tippers!"
"While this app overall works well there is one thing I take serious with.  It is the hidden surcharges for various toppings, sauces, crusts etc. When using a coupon there is no way to see what choices are causing the charge of the pizza to be more then the special price. You are surprised with the extra charges in your cart and then no way of knowing what choice caused the extra charges. I have played extensively with this, adding and removing toppings to try and discover by process of elimination which choices are causing the surcharges and have found nothing is consistent. I can have similar toppings on two different pizzas and one will have a surcharge and the other will not. It feels like to me they are hiding these extra charges as a way to unethically increase the price of their pizzas beyond the special price.   Also, they should add Apple Pay and a payment choice for convenience.  I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôll continue to use this app unless they decide to change their ways which means my business will be going to their competitors."
"I have been using this app for years now. I tried placing an order online using a debit card with sufficient funds and when I tried to finalize everything told me that there was an error. So I was like ‚Äúok maybe I didn‚Äôt add enough money to my card‚Äù but that wasn‚Äôt the case. After it told me that there was a card error the only option to click next was ‚ÄúOkay‚Äù. So I tried to re-order and use my debit card once more, and it still said it failed. At this point I figured it was something to do with my bank, maybe a bill hit me at a coincidental time. But nope, I just see that I was billed twice and over $40 had been taken out of my account. 

I called my bank to try to file a dispute. When I had told her the situation she told me that she was only seeing one transaction bounce back, however she did see the one failed attempt go through. 
After she told me that and I had filed the one claim I called my local Domino‚Äôs to see if they had received the money and or my order. They told me they haven‚Äôt received either. 

This has been my only issue with this app, I have had no other complaints or disappointments up until now. I would recommend adding a feature that says ‚ÄúPlease do not try to pay again, for it might make a duplicate charge‚Äù like I know most apps do. 

Please don‚Äôt overlook this. I am extremely upset."
"There‚Äôs no where to add tip at checkout when using iPadOS version when paying with card
Can it still be called ‚Äúcontactless‚Äù when you have to answer the door because they can‚Äôt just put whatever they want as tip and certainly wouldn‚Äôt just accept no tip. Who wouldn‚Äôt knock for that? But then they hand you your pizza. Tried calling the store to just go ahead and tell them but being on hold gets old (no pun intended) and so does having to explain every time ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm not placing an order‚Äù and why there was no tip.
Obviously, I could just be seeing where to enter the tip but even then it should only be in one place at checkout.
Whichever scenario it may be, even though a small oversight, is still an issue that should be addressed.

<<<I‚Äôm done using the app until that one is fixed.>>>

Also, there‚Äôs no way to add special instructions without tricking the system with a work around.
The only way to get a well done pizza when ordering via the iPadOS version of the app is by first, using a non-iPadOS version of the app that does have special instructions to create an easy order where you had the option for well done selected and then, back on the iPadOS version, selecting your easy order.
After that, it‚Äôs there miraculously. 
But only for that pizza.

Beautiful app, but serious flaws that shouldn‚Äôt be hard to fix or even take that long to do so."
"This will be the 4th time I‚Äôm trying to place an order through the app.  After adding what I wanted and I get to the checkout part, I place the order and it tells me that there was an issue with the payment.  Which there shouldn‚Äôt be because I do have the funds.  In the same message it gives me a number to call and it turns out to be one of the stores, which turned out to be ZERO help.  I try telling the guy on the phone what‚Äôs happening and he simply hangs up.  I call again about just placing my order and as soon as I mention the free pizza I earned he hangs up! Now I‚Äôm of course gonna order more than the free pizza and I love dominoes, but if this problem is going to keep happening to me well I‚Äôm sorry but you guys are going to loose a loyal customer.  Please can we rectify this issue???"
"This is the best delivery gluten free pizza! I almost like it better than the original crust. It's a real treat for my daughter and a huge convenience for us as a family to be able to order a delicious gluten free product delivered to our door.
We also love the sandwiches and of course the bread twists. I really like how easy the app makes ordering. The text alert and call reminder to let me know the driver is on their way is very helpful as our home is hard to spot from the street. This way we can know when to look for the driver in case we need to flag them down and I am not alarmed by an unexpected knock at my door, especially if I am not feeling well and a kid has to answer. The pizza points are a nice bonus to earn free pizza. We order regularly so this is a nice perk that I truly appreciate.
Thanks Domino's üòä"
"I do enjoy watching my meal‚Äôs progress! And I don‚Äôt have to worry that my order was misunderstood.

In the past month or so; however, I have had trouble logging in (it doesn‚Äôt recognize my email when I use the @ from the numbers keyboard) AND once I do get in I have only been able to order using my previous orders - the app crashes (looks like it is going to a website and hangs on a blank page) when I try to create or edit a pizza. Thankfully, I usually order the same thing. I won‚Äôt just call the store, because I want to earn rewards. Also, there are better pizza places that deliver in my area... the convenience of the app is the only reason I buy Domino‚Äôs.

January 2019 and I still cannot create a new pizza! Once this order is done I will have earned a free pizza. I will get that and quit Domino‚Äôs. There are several pizza places in the area that have much better quality, and the gas will be a lot less than a $3.99 delivery charge. It‚Äôs too bad that the company doesn‚Äôt monitor their reviews and fix the problem."
"The app is decent. It's great for placing orders and I love how it let's me know through my Apple Watch that my order is being made or is on its way for delivery.

The UI could use some work though, and the app often forgets my login details after new versions get downloaded.

I think the ordering process in the app is the minimum of what I expect. I think improvements can be made which would greatly increase my satis-app-tion.

1) A visual representation of my pizza would be nice. I like how Subway's recent app update presents my subs and lets me adjust toppings and the like.

2) An AppleTV app would be awesome so I can order using my Siri Remote and get notifications on my watch, phone, tablet and laptop at the various stages of my order.

3) It would be great to see some details on my pizza delivery person, similar to how Uber gives me details I can confirm with my Uber driver.

4) Some iOS specific touches would be nice. Swipe to remove an expired card for example‚Ä¶ 3D Touch to see ingredients on a pizza before I tap six times to order the damned thing‚Ä¶ Even an Easy Order button in the iOS dashboard (with weather and news) to let me order my Easy Order with one touch.

All of these would be much more helpful from my pizza app than the digital assistant bot they added‚Ä¶"
I love this store. Pizza is always ready quick and good just like I like it. I do have one problem. I actually worked in a dominos as a teenager as a customer service rep. I liked it a lot but always tried to be polite to my customers. BUT When I use the drive through at this particular dominos they literally just look at me and same ‚Äúwhat was the name...?‚Äù In stead of ‚Äúwelcome to Dominos how can I help you?‚Äù This seems picky but it‚Äôs just rude for them to be so brash. I know working in fast food can be one of efficiency but you gotta have good customer service to keep your customers. Please work on this. It gets more annoying the more I go. I am a business owner myself. So I know how important this is. I fully support this store. I know this can be fixed. Please fix it from a valued customer. Thank you!
"I‚Äôve had this app for a while and it‚Äôs not well managed or thought through by Dominoes - shame on them! They are too big a company to have issues like changing the delivery location, yet the app won‚Äôt sync or allow you to change it, and will not allow you to order from the location set by ‚Äúthem‚Äù in the app. Don‚Äôt bother using their chat feature. It‚Äôs a ‚Äúbot‚Äù that can only take an order and is not a real person answering questions. Also, don‚Äôt bother calling to use or redeem points that you‚Äôve spend your hard earned money to save. I was told they didn‚Äôt know what our rewards were, and to call customer service, but they can‚Äôt transfer me because it‚Äôs a different number and they don‚Äôt know it. This is the most unorganized app & company out there. I doubt they even have real ‚Äúdevelopers‚Äù working on this app much less managing it. Horrible interface and deceiving to tell you to use your points! I‚Äôm calling Pizza Hut, then after that I‚Äôm calling consumer affairs!!!"
"This app is very easy to use and the ability to schedule a delivery for later is genius!  With my wife hard at work in the kitchen, I can smell disaster coming.  This app allows me to schedule the pizza for 20 minutes after she says dinner will be done.  We all sit at the table and poke inquisitively at a main course that is so over-cooked that it is not recognizable anymore.  This is balanced by the still frozen in the center side dish and nearly raw vegetables.  But wait, who is that at the door?  The delivery driver!  He saves me from what is sure to be a trip to the ER and months of abuse investigations from child services for making my children eat what we lovingly call my wife‚Äôs gourmet feast.  Thank you dominos!  Saved by the app and not having to hide in the garage while I call dominos on the phone!"
"The app claims to tell you where your pizza is, but this is not always the case.  Multiple times this has happened where the app says that my pizza has been delivered, but it is still another 30-40 minutes before my pizza arrives tasting like a cardboard box.  I have even called the store to ask where my pizza is and they simply tell me it‚Äôs on its way.  I would order from Dominos more but after the third time this has happened, it‚Äôs just not worth it.  In total, my last order took an hour to arrive even though the app said it was delivered about 40 minutes earlier.

Overall, the app is great and when the pizza tracker used to work for me, I loved the app, even telling friends to try it because it‚Äôs so cool, but if slow drivers are just going to mark my pizza delivered as soon as they leave the store, then what‚Äôs the point?  

Try the app out if you want, hopefully you have a better experience, but I‚Äôm really dissatisfied with Dominos."
"... on my iPhone 7 I can‚Äôt delete things off my order. It‚Äôs a great app otherwise, but that element is so frustrating that it loses two stars in my book. I mean, I just ordered dinner and I had to close the app twice and start over because people changed there minds on what they wanted and I COULDN‚ÄôT remove those items no matter how hard I tried! One other thing that frustrates me is that when you order something that comes with a dipping sauce, they only give you a few preselected options to choose from. Like I can‚Äôt order plain wings and get the garlic dipping sauce with it (so good by the way!). So I‚Äôm stuck with a random sauce I won‚Äôt use and I have to pay for a garlic dipping sauce separate. They need to make all sauces available to pick from."
"We ordered our pizza and wings at 6:20 pm and the time estimate said it would be a 89 to 99 minute wait which I was ok with. Fast forward 150 minutes and the tracker says it has been out of the oven for an hour. At this point I‚Äôm thinking I don‚Äôt want to eat a pizza that has been sitting and waiting to be delivered for an hour. We decided to call and see where our pizza actually was, like was it on its way and the tracker just doesn‚Äôt say delivery until it‚Äôs delivered? When talking to an employee though, he informed us that it would be another hour to an hour and a half until our order would be delivered. Had we been informed from the beginning it would have been a 4 hour wait we would have not ordered and then waited 2 hours. While talking to the employee on the phone he said that the tracker was extremely inaccurate and they hadn‚Äôt even prepped our pizza. 

To sum it up, fix the tracker and give accurate time estimates."
"This is the best app. It‚Äôs completely user-friendly, it saves your ‚Äòeasy order‚Äô and with a few simple steps you‚Äôll have fresh, hot pizza at your doorstep. I think the app has nailed it with its ability to choose from so many options, from sauces, to cheeses, to topping all with the option to divide pizza with one side with certain toppings and the other side with other toppings. You get a great selection without the hassle of not being to make the choices you want or the app not letting you do something, etc. This is my family‚Äôs go-to dinner when practices run long, or homework piles up and there‚Äôs nothing to eat. The best part is that they support St. Jude Children‚Äôs Research Hospital and with one more step you can (if you wish) donate money to this amazing charity!"
"My husband and I love Domino‚Äôs pizza. We‚Äôve ordered pizza to be delivered at least every week-and-a-half to two weeks since we moved to this area seven years ago. We‚Äôve always had great service, yummy pizza and prompt delivery‚Äî that is, until recently. For the past couple of months, when we watch the tracker after ordering, it ‚Äústalls‚Äù at Quality Check and sometimes stays there for a half hour before it tells us that it‚Äôs out for delivery. Needless to say, the pizza isn‚Äôt at its best when it finally arrives. We understand that there are busy times and we don‚Äôt mind waiting when it is busy. This seems to be a regular occurrence now though, week night or weekend. Last week we tried a different pizza place and it came much faster; but it wasn‚Äôt even close to being as good as Domino‚Äôs. Please, Domino‚Äôs, get your act together!"
"I Order Domino‚Äôs quite a bit. My kid loves their pizza so I probably order delivery 1 to 2 times a week.  I usually order an Italian sandwich.  They have a selection to remove the veggies but if you want extra peppers or one of the other veggies even though the plus sign is there it doesn‚Äôt work.  They barely put any on there to start with and when I order no banana peppers and no onions I see just a few little green spots that I assume are green peppers.  I think the receipt should call for more to begin with but lacking that I‚Äôd like the option to add more.  I can‚Äôt.  So I order online then call in to have them add them. I‚Äôm sure they hate that as much as I do. 

If someone from Domino‚Äôs actually reads these reviews it wouldn‚Äôt take a lot to update the app."
"So far seems to be working well.  Had an issue adding another form of payment, the app said that I had already entered it, but it was not there so when I entered it again it said that it was a duplicate?  Maybe it was a user error?  I am hungry and ordering pizza through an app - I can‚Äôt complain too much, can I?  

30 years ago I would have had to pick up my rotary phone and call in to Dominos be put on hold for 10-15 minutes (while they helped other callers), then place my order from a paper menu that I had on my fridge.  The one thing that I do miss from back then is the guaranteed 30 minute delivery.  Oh well, life goes on.  This review took longer than ordering and paying for my pizza.  Hopefully my pizza is out for delivery now ;-)"
I‚Äôve had this app in my phone for years and I have not had a problem until recently. Someone was able to gain access to my account and place two different orders to two different states. Initially when I was contacted by the bank to determine if this was fraudulent activity I thought that my number credit card number had somehow gotten out. It wasn‚Äôt until a couple of days later when checking my email I came across the two order confirmations from Dominos at that point I realized that my card number had been compromised from this app. My email address is linked to it. I don‚Äôt plan on using this app again due to the stress it caused (having to visit the bank in the middle of a pandemic to get a replacement card). In the future I will place all of my orders over the phone and pay with cash. It‚Äôs a shame because the app is really helpful and easy to use.
"When I first install this app it was everything!  I was able to order with ease, collect points and know when my order was being made and delivered but the past few months I have tried to use it and it has not worked.  I get all the way to the part where I‚Äôm supposed to pay and there‚Äôs always an issue and it‚Äôs not my phone nor is it my card because I‚Äôve tried on multiple phones and different payment methods and I always end up having to call the store to place my order.  I‚Äôve even called several numbers that could not tell me anything about the problem with the app because I can only use my free pizzas on the App which is BAD if the app is not working! Please fix this. I have even uninstalled and reinstalled hoping that would work. FYI- using an iPhone as I always have been even when it worked properly."
"Dominos sounds like communism especially with the disclaimer they prompt with when doing a store pick up. They mandate that if you‚Äôre not fully vaccinated then you need to wear a cloth mask such as a bandana, face covering, scarf, etc. for the safety of their staff. Unless you‚Äôre ‚Äúfully vaccinated‚Äù which is defined as having two jabs of Maderna or Pfizer or one jab of J&J. This is a load of crap. Cloth masks obviously don‚Äôt offer any protection from airborne particulates and the vaccine doesn‚Äôt protect anyone from contracting COVID. It‚Äôs all about power and control and not science. Good job Domino‚Äôs you stupid communists I didn‚Äôt think a pizza parlor would work for China and big pharma but there you are not giving a crap about individual freedoms. I‚Äôd like to know if the CEO/president is actually masked up and vaccinated, and if their antibodies are actually protecting him/her/they/them/commie from the virus. What a lunatic. Glad the Domino‚Äôs in my hometown doesn‚Äôt enforce these policies but I‚Äôm still not giving them my business anymore."
"It is so easy to select your items and place your order.  You can save your previous orders so that you can re-order them with just a mouse click or two, even applying the coupons you used in the past.  The real time tracker is a great idea, but doesn't always seem that accurate. It would be neat to see something more real time visual like a GPS tracker that shows where the driver is on a map like Uber does.  I didn't used to eat Dominos pizza, but they made it so easy to order that I order every week now. I also really like their rewards program.  The app tracks that too so you don't have to wonder how many points you have and then have to log into a different app. And also reminds you when you have free pizzas, which is really cool."
"Have had multiple attempts to get an burn free pizza that isn‚Äôt a hand tossed or pan pizza. We actually got a credit once for a replacement order. Then they still burned it again. This is specifically the store in Greensboro, NC on Fleming Road. We keep ordering as some only get 1/8th burned vs the whole pie. But after the fourth order of completely burned gluten free pizza, we will not order again. Ever. This attempt tonight will be our last attempt to try tonight with a thin crust. The store owner was nice the first time. Told us to mark ‚Äúlight cook‚Äù on the thin and GF pizzas. But there is no place to mark light cook. It has normal cook, dark cook. No light cook anywhere on the app. We‚Äôve given up. We don‚Äôt buy again from this store as it is only and always THIS particular Domino‚Äôs pizza. You‚Äôd think if they‚Äôd see thinner crust and a gf crust, they are both thin and thus need to be checked on prior to a regular pizza."
"I stopped at this store today and asked what the specials were for the day.  A very nice and professional woman by the name of Victoria explained the options of the day.  When I started to place the order, it indicated that for that special it had to be placed online.  So, I downloaded the dominos app and Victoria helped me navigate to save time and since I had never used the app before.  I can easily say that it is due to employees like Victoria, that an impression of dominos results in a positive or negative experience.  It is the way you are treated with any business, that makes a positive or negative impression of the name.  I will definitely be back often, due to the professional and courteous manner that Victoria treated me.  I hope dominos recognizes the value they have in such a dedicated employee as Victoria."
"We aren‚Äôt rating the pizza here. 
This review is for the app.  I find it very useful, and I use it equally well from iphone or PC.  I really like two of the features:
1) ORDER HISTORY - The app keeps a recent order history and lets you resubmit a previous order with the same menu options and payment info.  We happen to like our custom orders, so we tend to repeat the identical order time after time.  For us, this app is a big timesaver ....brilliant!  Without getting out of my chair I placed our usual 2-pizza carryout order in about two minutes. 

2) TRACKER - This app shows the status of your food order.  Is it ready for pickup? Is it going to be awhile yet?  Helps me get to the carryout counter usually right about the time my pies are coming out of the oven."
"So I been using this app for a very long time and honestly dislike the small fact that you can‚Äôt make a comment about your order for example I just ordered 3 pizza 3 garlic butter dips,bread bites and a 2 letter of coke it was about 40 buck so it was a great deal till I got ranch instead of garlic butter dip for my bread, I didn‚Äôt get my soda at and to top it off one of my pizzas were cold and while one was kinda warm and the other was oddly extremely hot and that would be undesirable if I was a far distance away but google maps say it‚Äôs a 3 minute drive from the dominos I was thinking darn I gave the guy a tip  to lol next but honestly it‚Äôs quite often a problem where I‚Äôm told oh sorry I forgot you soda (and or)dipping sauce and etc maybe I‚Äôm just ordering from the wrong pizza place I mean Rocky‚Äôs pizza joint is just down the street it‚Äôs a bit more pricey but I guess the story is you get what you pay for"
"I had a Dominos Pizza while station at Fort Lee VA. in the 1975 and it tasted like the box. We Order the 2 for $5.99 two topping pizza‚Äôs and they were delivered by a very friendly professional Driver and the Pizza taste great compared to other competitors. I downloaded the app today and ordered the 3 topping $7.99 Pizza and found it very easy to make a 1/2 & 1/2 Pizza that my wife and love and nicked named it after our names. Dominos for low cost Pizza is our first choice. At check we paid $2.00 more for some premium toppings we selected, but that was fine.  Tip to see the advertised specials in the app, select add coupon and then you can select the special and create your Pizza.  While I wrote this review, I have been sent two status messages. Got to go and get that pie."
I would order Waymore than when I normally do and I‚Äôve been a loyal customer for a while but these prices after delivery are too expensive especially for customers who don‚Äôt have transportation for the price I paid for one pizza after delivery I could‚Äôve bought two from Little Caesars or three from Pizza patron I really think that y‚Äôall should work on the prices after delivery because you‚Äôre making it really expensive for a customers and I really think if you Caint discount all of them then use your discount loyal customers or after so many orders that would make you a lot more money been a lot more business or just discounting a few dollars it would make a big difference and I would be ordering way more
"This app takes away all my issues that revolve around ordering from Dominoes via web ‚Äî the delivery fee is factored into the price before checkout so I feel as though the app is more honest with the information in regards to what the customer is required to pay. I love the app functionality as far as how it fills out coupons and compiles orders. However I wish the app was a little more immersive ‚Äî if there were basic animations or a more dynamic flow of the elements on screen I would probably feel more compelled to use the app since it would be more rewarding to interact with the interface. 

Overall though it‚Äôs a great app. Looking forward to using it in the future. Can‚Äôt wait for my next free pizza!

Side note: Make cinnamon pizza a thing!"
I like this app because it is easy to use and there is always coupons Available. Now every time first of all over 3 time when I entered my card information the app charges my card then tells me something went wrong with the app and I never get my food the employees from 116th and Lexington dominos will ignore your call and tell you your only options is to either reorder and pay again or it is nothing they can do. Second when I order my food takes a long time to come the delivery men are usually nice but most wont even call wen downstairs so sometimes they just take my order back to the store which is annoying after waiting over a hour and a half for your food in the first place then you get the email saying you received and to rate food that never showed up
"Pasta is surprisingly great. Pizza not too bad. Chicken, I could  live without. Trying the sandwich ( Philly cheese steak) tonight. Will let you know.  I have had worse like Abby‚Äôs in OC. I am a picky eater with   strong taste buds.  So trust me.  I love Italian food and spices.  If I say not too bad, then is isn‚Äôt. Fast speedy cooking and delivery.  The drivers really like it if you live in an apartment, that you give instructions of the building you live in and the vicinity of your apartment.  Go the extra mile for them and they will go the extra mile for you, being at your doorstep literally 20 minutes from the time they put it in the oven. Which the tracker says is as soon as I hit place order on my phone. Oh and for desert.  the cookie browny. Enough for 4 people. They do sometimes over cook it."
"It‚Äôs convenient and easy to place my order on this app BUT... I can‚Äôt add any requests or modifications that I need because there is no place for it anywhere on this app. I need my thin crust pizza baked to a light golden brown, without any hard dark brown or blackened crust. I have a jaw problem that requires me to avoid hard crunchy food or experience the painfully throbbing results. Unfortunately most pizzas delivered from my local store is baked with a dark brown crunchy crust. If this app had an area for simple requests then I would have a record that they would be less apt to ignore & unable to deny that they received. This small improvement could save many customers. I am a frequent patron who is ready to take my substantial orders elsewhere if I don‚Äôt get an effective tool to communicate my needs clearly when ordering. I hope they are paying attention."
"Besides a love for their thin crust pizza and pasta bread bowls, I love their app. Makes ordering so easy. I love how it tracks my order and has options to be texted when my delivery driver enters my neighborhood. Delivery pizza is for busy nights when I don‚Äôt feel like cooking- and being able to track my order makes it so easy to know to expect my order is to be arriving so I can still work on whatever I am doing, and know exactly how much time I got before it‚Äôs time to chow down! My orders have been accurate with every order (and I use this app a lot LOL) and delivery is always fast and courteous. I wish all my other favorite food places had as easy to navigate app. 5 stars!"
"I spent a lot of time placing an order with this app. I would have gone with a different provider if I wasn‚Äôt ordering for the birthday girl who wanted a Brooklyn style crust. So, you almost lost business solely because of this app. First, I had to delete my order and redo it 4 times because it kept having a pricing error. Then, I have to say, 2020 and I still can‚Äôt use apple pay or PayPal, but have no choice but to enter my card info which it didn‚Äôt save even though it asked me twice if I wanted to save. Last, my location insists on contactless delivery, which is great, but there is no place to add a tip during the checkout process, so I‚Äôm going to have to contact my driver if I want to give them a tip. I have no problems with the quality of your pizza or customer service, but the ordering experience will send me to your competitors next time."
"I grew up with Dominos in the late 80‚Äôs and 90‚Äôs. Yeah, I dig a slice of happiness every so often. But as I got older, so did the same old pizza delivery. I started making my own, and learned a good recipe and tricks of the trade, with family and friends. Dominos became a second best to what I could do on my own at home. In the last couple of years, Dominos has kicked up their game, times have been changing, and Dominos has changed with the times. For the better. Now, I don‚Äôt always eat pizza, because my wife is a great cook of many styles, but when we don‚Äôt have time to cook, or I am on a business trip, like today, I sit back and relax with that slice of happiness again. It‚Äôs good to treat yourself with a slice of happiness every so often. Dominos provides!"
"I called them when one hour passed and the lady on the phone said that my pizza would be there shortly. I said thanks and hung up, then I called again and a different lady answered and asked where is my pizza. She said that it just came out of the oven and that it‚Äôs being boxed and next in line for delivery. I said thanks and hung up. I was looking outside my window and saw the dominos car drive off in another street and passed right by my house. Like 15 mini passed by and called again. A man answered and said that the driver came back with the pizza saying that it was incomplete or something. He said I should just cancel it and I told him I didn‚Äôt and then he just hung up. The disrespect in that. I ordered again because saw it was canceled on the dominos app and now I‚Äôm waiting for my pizza. Btw I ordered the pizza around 4:00 pm. It‚Äôs currently 8:22 and still nothing. Honestly I am never going to order of off this dominos and go with a better company. This dominos needs to be checked up on."
"This application makes indecisive ordering much easier for everyone involved. Especially when in a room full of drunk people at midnight. Saves the unfortunate employee who would have answered the call the trouble of having to listen to belligerent and incoherent background noise. Noise that drowns out the drunkard's poor attempt at rambling off a $40 order that will be forgotten long before they ask to have it repeated back to them. Less room for error if the customer is control of the order. Especially while using such a well designed yet harmoniously simplistic user interface. Well done, Dominos. Also, 100% only composed this review so it would stop asking me to rate the application every time I use it!"
"Most dominos have a sense of pride. They care about how their pizza is made, delivered, and handled. I don't want to go as far as to expound that this dominos in particular lacks this crucial trait, but I do want to say that I've witnessed the contrary first hand‚ÄîI've seen some things about this dominos no one should know. Hence,  I shall not speak on such atrocities. I can speak on some of its redeeming qualities which is important to consider if one is to grasp a cogent understanding of this establishment's integrity. They care about the crust, their faster that Subway's delivery system, and god do they love putting on extra pepperoni (some may say this is a deficit, but not for myself and my son Leonardo). If there is anything in particular this dominos could do to regain my trust, my support, and my condemning or exalting stars it is a free large pizza made, handled, and delivered with care. It's not easy to forget and forgive, but such a gesture may rectify my sworn grievances."
"I called in for a pizza delivery yesterday evening. After 2 hours I called the Dominos store in Watsonville, Ca. 512 Main St., and asked why there was a delay. The woman who answered the phone told me that it was delivered. I told it it had not. I live in a mobile home park and my door was open to the porch and the dog never barked. I know that it was not delivered. I asked to verify with the ‚Äúdriver‚Äù but she told me he was the assistant manager and wouldn‚Äôt lie. I asked to speak to the manager as she told me that they would not credit me back for the purchase. And she also said that SHE was the assistant manager but would not give me her name. I was shocked by her attitude and called her 2 more times only to have her hang up on me. I will never buy anything from a Dominos and will let my local friends know how awful this particular store is. Wish I didn‚Äôt have to give her a star but it‚Äôs the only way to warn other Watsonville people."
"About a month ago I had really bad service. Talked to a manager and he didn‚Äôt have very good customer service. I
Work In pizza so I know how it feels to be short staff and drivers. I understand having to wait 2 hours for a delivery If your busy but I can update my online quote time. Idk If you can but If
You can‚Äôt you should at least notify your customers. I seem on the tracker where my pizza was in the rack
For 45 min so I call the store and the managers says we‚Äôre short drivers I said that understandable but will you please remake mine so it‚Äôs not cold he
Goes to tell me you have heating racks. Well yea but those are to be used
To keep warm for 5 min max the
Food gets cold we have them too, he then says well it‚Äôs bout to leave I‚Äôll give
You a discount I said that‚Äôs
Fine I don‚Äôt wanna wait any longer.
Well my order gets here and it‚Äôs Luke warm and a 2$ discount really?? I didn‚Äôt want food free I hate giving free food away and I hate complaining bc no one is perfect but seriously? I don‚Äôt eat pizza bc I work at papa Johns we don‚Äôt have pasta or subs and that‚Äôs what we get. So I tried again last night and it was fast and hot. I would of complained along time ago but app didn‚Äôt offer a review."
"My husband and I order from here frequently. Tonight we decided to go with Pizza Hut because we had a coupon. We placed the order at 9:30p and when 10:30p hit I called to see what was up. They had no record of our order and the lady hung up on me. My husband called back and she said they were closed, they do not close until midnight. We then were told they were out of pizza dough and couldn‚Äôt make our order. Long story short we are starving at this point and opted for dominoes! This branch is always right on. The pizza is always cooked perfect, toppings plentiful, quick service and with a smile. Never again will we go against our better judgment and not get dominoes. They always come through!"
"The app it‚Äôs self is fine to a degree. However there needs to be an option to leave a tip when you place your order otherwise what good is the whole contactless delivery, especially when the driver waits for you to tip and sign the receipt? Your sharing a pen that could potentially be contaminated.  No I‚Äôm not some crazy scared to get sick person, I‚Äôm just pointing that out. Next let‚Äôs talk specialty chicken, why can‚Äôt you add extra toppings? You can remove them but not add? That need to be corrected immediately. Dominos, you‚Äôre losing out on additional profits. Make a ‚Äúbuild your own‚Äù chicken option just like pizza and pasta. Once again you‚Äôre losing out on additional profits. People like to customize their food and the points I‚Äôve made would not hurt your bottom line in any way."
They are so fast and the food doesn‚Äôt ever disappoint we order it about once a week and I have been completely happy with my food all but one time and that‚Äôs understandable human error happens no one is perfect and it was also a new menu item so they just may have not known the trick to making it yet  Not to mention the drivers are polite kind and are at my door so quickly it rarely takes as long as it says it might on the app! We have always tipped well and we get top notch service each and every time like I mean above and beyond! they deserve it and they will remember next time you order. Try the sandwiches they are so good I love the habanero one you won‚Äôt be disappointed it‚Äôs amazing!
"but annoying glitchy. always check that your store you submit order is the same one you wanted as you started your order. we have two stores we frequent and it always forgets and defaults to the other in the middle of ordering. this past order required me to sign in 5 times, it kept forgetting me even after clicking the box that says keep me signed in. I really wish we could keep a list of favorite orders ready to go. It will remember your last order but may or may not remember the coupons‚Ä¶ it could be 3 x the price. But you can‚Äôt select your favorite order from a list and know what is in it. I‚Äôve been known to order not what I really wanted only to make the process go faster since the app is frustrating with so many steps."
really where despite the fact despite the fact makes it extremely convenient and user-friendly I also feel that your staff members should make the same accommodations of a simple application user-friendly and easy. However in most cases in the location that I frequent which is 68th and Capitol in Milwaukee Wisconsin. The staff has the same attitude and mentality on a regular basis I don‚Äôt want to be at work hurry up and pay so you can get the hell out of my face this is the exact feeling that I get every time. What I have learned in my work experience is that you have to work for the job that you want not for the job that you have take pride in even the smallest things I wish a secret shopper could experience what I mean take care.
"I ordered 3 pizzas for the following day to be delivered to my office for a lunch meeting at 12:15.  The tracker said the delivery person left the restaurant at 12:16(less than 1/4 mile away). I started calling at 12:35 and each time I spent 5-10 minutes on hold before being told my order was ‚Äúalmost there‚Äù.  It finally arrived at 1:10 by which time the meeting was over and my colleagues were starving.  It was cold and nearly inedible. I talked to a manager 2 hours later who promised to put a credit of $25 in my account, though I would have preferred a refund.  Today, 24 hours later, no credit in my account.  Repeated calls to the restaurant have gone unanswered.  They just put every call on hold."
If you guys add a notes section to each item when we are ordering to let you all know how we would like our food cooked (ex: wings Fried hard/All Flats etc) or a notes section where we can let the people who are preparing the food know not to forget an item on our food or order If we‚Äôve experienced this issue in the past would be great. I do the build your own hoagie a lot on and get the mushroom delight. The hoagies are already supposed to come with pizza sauce AUTOMATICALLY and I add mushroom sauce but no one I guess is trained to know that. All they see if mushroom sauce and whatever else I add to it. So I always have to call back when I get my order and say hey you left off the pizza sauce. Other than that it a be 5 stars for me.
"This app is excellent... very easy to use. Great to see the tracker, and great to see where your order is in the process... as well as how far away the driver is!

I do have a suggestion for an improvement though. When I use the app on the phone, I get the option to tip using the card I‚Äôm paying with. When I use the app on my iPad, I don‚Äôt get that option.

Please add this feature to the iPad version of the app. I‚Äôve been getting orders ready on my iPad, and then remembered I can‚Äôt pre-tip (usually at check out), and then starting over again on my phone. It‚Äôs a small thing, but it would make the app even better. Thank you!"
"You know what? This app is pretty good. Its pretty easy to build a pizza.  And the fact I can still be at work, but order a pizza for my kids remotely - because an emergency came up and I wasn‚Äôt able to make it home in time to make them dinner - is awesome. The problem? After I placed the order through the app, I asked my 14-year-old to get a cash tip for the pizza delivery person, because I‚Äôm not allowed to add a tip on when I order through the app.  He had it in his pocket when she arrived with the pizza. Before he even had a chance to pull the tip out of his pocket, she gave him some snide comment... ‚Äúyou know... you‚Äôre supposed to tip.‚Äù The attitude was unneeded, when he had every plan to tip her - and he did.  But I understand her resentment as well, because the stupid app doesn‚Äôt offer the ability add a tip at the outset.  It just creates negativity that isn‚Äôt needed.  DOMINOES - FIX YOUR APP AND ALLOW CUSTOMERS TO ADD A TIP."
"Sick and tired of always having to sign-in to the app. I have security on my device. It should be my choice to not always sign-in.

I get you remember CC info, but keep it hidden and unusable until I sign in. I always pay cash and this has cost you 10‚Äôs of orders from when I on the spur of the moment decide to order a pizza easily and it‚Äôs nowhere near easy. I want to click and go so to speak. It‚Äôs easier to just pick up the phone and order from your competitors then hunt down my account info to just make a cash delivery order. 

You are not the best pizza in town, if I gotta do it the hard way, I will order the good stuff, as in not Dominoes. Your niche is fast and easy, don‚Äôt make it slow and hard to order from you."
"Your pizza and menu isn‚Äôt only hugely better (I noticed this about 6 years ago or so) than long ago when Pizza Hut all but had you beat, but you finally got me to write a review about your app. Your app is easy and great. I keep earning free pizzas without having to do anything . The other guys‚Äô rewards programs read like credit card agreements. It gives you total control over what you want and how your want it ;). I like how the ‚Äònighttime gel capsule‚Äô looking tracker lets me see where my pizza is in the process (or does it look more like a Tide pod?). Anyhow, good stuff Dominos. PS Does everyone in my neighborhood work for you? There are more delivery cars for dominos out some days than other people driving."
"App has been great until now. Picked my pizza then it tock me to a screen with drinks, deserts and other items. But no prices?  I wanted to see a couple of prices so I picked a couple, then it tock me to a donation page. From there it tock me to checkout but still no prices and no way to confirm my order???  That‚Äôs messed up.

Also I was ordering a pizza in a city I don‚Äôt know. I picked the closest Domino‚Äôs and then placed the order BUT once the order is placed, there is no way to see the address anymore to put it into my gps. I had to find the email to get the address. That‚Äôs messed up to.

I hate programmers that make assumptions: assuming I know the prices (or don‚Äôt care) and assuming I know where I‚Äôm going."
"I love using the dominos app to order and earning free pizza isn‚Äôt a bad deal either! My only problem with the app is that when I order pasta it will not allow me to ask for extra alfredo sauce on the pasta so as soon as I place the order I have to immediately call the store and ask for extra sauce! We love the chicken alfredo but the pasta is just a little too dry for my family if we don‚Äôt order extra sauce on it. Not only does the app not allow me to order extra sauce, there is no where for me to leave a comment on my order to ask for extra sauce that way. I order online to earn my rewards points but I still have to call the store as soon as I submit my order. If it wasn‚Äôt for this I would absolutely give you 5 stars and then some."
"Love the new ingredients and the pizza is very good overall, but sometimes late at night the service gets sketchy, like the employees stop answering phones and won‚Äôt deliver food at certain times and sometimes I can see there point but a lot of times I fell they do it out of laziness. I work in a restraint and take orders 1 minutes before close and they wouldn‚Äôt deliver my food one time with 45 minutes to close. There was no reason for them not to make the order other than pure laziness, and I blame management for letting the employees get away with it. And phone calls should be answered no matter what that‚Äôs why I tend to order online. Pizza is always worth it tho 5/5 for sure"
"I love Dominos pizza I have my whole Life. The app however is not user friendly. I almost always get a little frustrated when navigating an order. Sometimes it‚Äôs just not that clear whether or not i‚Äôve ordered what I want. Know that ordering on this app means work. Also, how do you order the same order you got last time? Why do you have to build it from scratch doesn‚Äôt seem very user-friendly or smart?! Last, what not combined some of the coupons!? We would order so much more pizza if we could combine the coupons! More money for you, for the stores, for the drivers, and more pizza for me and my family! Just sayn‚Äô"
"I order often using the app and it works great. This along with the pizzas being delicious & affordable makes Dominos my go to place for quick & easy pizza. But there was one situation where my father (he flys i buy) went to pick up the pizza and he was asked by the checkout girl if he had paid already. My father was not sure and was almost about to pay, but remembered me saying that ‚Äúthe app is great because I can use my amex to pay‚Äù. If not for this, my father would have paid twice for the pizzas, creating a headache. Bottom line, it is the staff‚Äôs responsibility to know 100% whether the pizzas have been paid for or not using the app. Having to ask customers is a bit unprofessional. But other then that minor hick-up, good stuff."
"EDIT: So this is just a suggestion: you guys should put the Dominos Tracker as a widget for the iPhone shortcut screen. (When you swipe right to access information instead of left for the camera). I would love that and I‚Äôm sure others would as well. =) <3 

-------------------------------------------

EDIT:
Domino‚Äôs is the best.

EDIT:
I have not checked up on my complaint above as I don't use that option as much anymore, however now the ""give feedback"" option after you order on the app is broken =( it keeps giving me an error pop up. That's like my favorite part of ordering!! However when you exit out of the original page and re-enter via the tracker button on the home page, it works fine.

-------------------------------------------

I would give this 5 stars (because I love dominoes and you guys are the best!!) but on the iPhone app you have the option for an easy order (which I use frequently). 
However when I click it, it does not give me the option for delivery/carry out or for WHERE I want it delivered. 

If you could fix that tiny little problem that would be awesome ^_^ <3 =)"
"My guilty pleasure is pan crust dominos pizza with garlic butter. No shame. This app is AWESOME for me. It‚Äôs so convenient to be able to just tap some buttons on an app and have my favorite food at my door, not to mention I live in a fairly rural area and dominos is the only place that will deliver here. My pizza is always hot and fresh when I get it, and always shows up in a timely fashion. I‚Äôve even had the store call me before to let me know why the one time it was late. The customer service is great and the app works beautifully and conveniently. Having the coupons and promotions in app to look at is great, between those and the piece of the pie rewards I‚Äôve saved hundreds of dollars on pizza in the last few years"
"Keeps forcing close on me! Can't even sign in!
So I go online for better service. I put in my order and track it. It'll say that it's on it's way then say it should've arrived & for me to enjoy. Meanwhile I'm waiting 2+ hours outside my dorm for the driver! I called in 3 times but the person speaking was just nonchalant and carefree like it's whatever. I wish sometimes the employees would imagine themselves in this frustrating situation. The driver called me and I answered but then they hung up so I texted them. Remember, I'm still standing outside. They tell me ""no answer so I left"". HOW!? I'm out here already because the tracker said you'd be here soon! I did NOT see any dominos car! So not only were they trying to play me but they lied. I'm assuming they called while on their way and decided to not even pull in when they didn't get an answer in time. Anyways it was midnight & I had class in the morning so I just canceled my order..."
"This is a well developed ordering app that has one glaring flaw. It screws the driver. If I select contactless delivery, there is NO WAY to add a tip for the driver. Don't even pretend you didn't think about this. I've sent feedback about this before, but it just goes to the local store manager who can do nothing about it.

I was a Domino's driver 35 years ago. There was no online ordering then and drivers were generally well tipped. But it's a different world now. People don't keep cash around just for tips. We like to use plastic and be done. By failing to include this simple function in your app, you leave me only two choices ‚Ä¶ get true contactless delivery and stiff the poor driver, or have a normal contact delivery and still have to tip in cash.

Fix this. I'm surprised you can keep drivers when you treat them this way."
"I really didn‚Äôt feel like cooking tonight, and after much hemming and hawing we decided on Dominos.  We ordered a pizza, a sandwich and a salad.  I must have put my order through on the app 2 seconds before they ran out of the sandwich stuff.  The store tried to call, but not knowing who it was, I didn‚Äôt answer.  My bad.
My husband went to the store to pick up the order, and called me when he got there to ask what I wanted instead.  I ordered a Hawaiian pizza (no peppers).  Being the amazing people that they are, they had looked at our previous orders, guessed what we might want and had already made another pizza! Magically, it was a Hawaiian pizza (no peppers)! 
Dominos at Washington Ave in Endicott, NY... you are amazing and magical!"
"Two things I‚Äôd like to see changed in the app are:
1st, the logon process. Having to still enter my email address/userid and password is archaic these days. Any app that is even trying to keep up with the times would allow you the option of saving your userid and the option on iPhones of using the finger print reader or Face ID for the password. 
2nd, the payment process. Once again, any app that is even trying to keep up ....., and once again, on iPhones, Apple Pay should be one of the payment options. 
Get with the times. Both of these convenience options for speeding up the ordering process have been available to app developers for years now. Try to keep up. 
Other than that, the app works fine."
"Hey Domino‚Äôs! Your pizza is tasty, the service is good, and the app is solid. There‚Äôs one improvement I would like to see happen on the app, however. I would love to see the delivery addresses all get their own delivery instruction slots on the Pizza Profile, so that customers who consistently order pizza from your restaurant, and have it go to the same location every time, don‚Äôt have to fill out the delivery instructions every single time they place an order. If the information is already there, it makes for a more efficient and timely process of getting tasty pizza out to your customers."
"One can summon sustenance to their door with a mere touch of their thumbs. The food is calorically rich so a rate of no more than two per week is key. However, there is room for improvement. Domino‚Äôs should take a view at a key to past success in which they revamped their company. In this age of scrutiny into business ethics offering a selection of healthier options would be a tremendous venture. Domino‚Äôs ability to change their business in a large ways has been documented in the late 2000s when they campaigned to change from the worst to the best. It is truly a testament to thinking critically about what aspects make a successful business. Ergo, they shall always have my business, or money."
"My / most local dominos are usually delivery only (there is 1 table with 2 seats in the franchise near me ) if most/ all of your orders are deliver or take out , how are you going to charge someone who lives less then 2 blocks away a $5.00 delivery fee and then expect me to tip my driver another 5 dollars ....I ordered 20 dollars worth of food added it all up and it didn‚Äôt cost over 25$ with taxes and delivery fee it said $45 and sense I used coupon I saved $20 but in reality the food only cost $20 so how did I save $20 ? If the delivery fee was what you needed to make money on delivery‚Äôs then I would get it but the fact is you wouldn‚Äôt have a business without delivery so stop ripping people off and charging them outrageous fees like Uber eats."
"Is the ""Pizza Scanner"" feature now defunct? The last several times I tried using it (in the previous update), I kept running into an error that prevent led me from progressing, and now (in the current update) I can't even find the feature in the dropdown menu or anywhere on the UI. Is it gone for good? If so, it didn‚Äôt last very long, especially considering it could only be used once a week. üôÅ A little forewarning next time would be great, should I need know I‚Äôll only ever be able to make use of an otherwise seemingly permanent feature 20+ times (if I maximize and capitalize upon my limited opportunities) before it goes out with a whimper and away for good."
"I have used this app for years. Suddenly last week, I tried to log in and got the message that it has been locked due to too many failed login attempts. So I requested a password change. They had no record of an account with my email. Then I uninstalled and reinstalled, created a new account with a different email. AGAIN it said my account was locked for too many failed lol in attempts! This is ridiculous and really inconvenient, as I order Domino‚Äôs at least once a week, and I like my points toward free pizzas!  Original review:
This app has made ordering super easy, especially when I use the one-click feature for my favorite pizza. I've never had a mistake, and even got a message once when a driver didn't show up for work, just to let me know it might take a little longer. Very happy with the app. Use it about once a week!"
"I have ordered a specific pizza from Domino's from home and in hotels around the country.  I have problems eating since radiation on my neck in 2016.  I found that I can eat the thin crust pizza. Using my laptop to order on line has never been a problem.  This iPhone App was a train wreck from the start.  I was supposed to get 50% off.  $5.99 is  NOT 50% of $8.99.  Who taught you math?  It should be $4.50.  Then order wouldn't go through because it didn't meet their minimum.  Not only do I have trouble eating since my treatment, I can't eat very much.  Can't finish a small pizza.  So, how is this supposed to work.  I ordered a salad, which I cannot eat.  Hoping my wife will eat it.  It cost more than the pizza.  What's up with that?  Very bad experience.  Will go back to my laptop or try Pizza Hut/Papa John.  Very disappointed."
"I would give this App 5 stars, but recently my app was hacked. The people who hacked my account are in a different state than me and they used all my pizza points to get a free pizza. I called the store once I was notified that the pizza was being made and told them that I did not order a pizza. They told me they would cancel the order once they got a photo of the I.D. of the person to turn it in to the fraud department. Then they told me to call customer service to get my points back. I have called 3 times (currently on hold waiting to talk to them again) and also written once..the only response I got was a generic email blaming me for the hack of their system. They didn‚Äôt say, we‚Äôre sorry this happened, or let us make this right..I‚Äôm not even asking for money back, I just want my points back. We use dominos all the time and I‚Äôm surprised they they aren‚Äôt interested in taking care of their customers."
"When it comes to ordering pizza on those lazy days when I don‚Äôt want to cook, Dominoe‚Äôs always comes in for the win. The app is great! You can see everything you want: specials, coupons, endless ingredient options and more. The app keeps track of previous orders which makes things sooooo much easier when you order for a group and always like the same things. It‚Äôs like 3 clicks and you‚Äôre done. Customer service is always on it too. The only reason why they are getting 4 and not 5 stars is because of the pizza tracker. Sometimes it will say that the pizza has been delivered/ arrived and it hasn‚Äôt yet (like is still another 20+ minutes away - which can be a pain when a group is waiting)...Otherwise, I love it."
"Please carry Provolone and Munster cheese at all of your stores/ or have a individualized location setting so I can order it on the APP, I‚Äôm tired of not being able to order the exact Pizza I wanted because you don‚Äôt offer the same options on the PHONE APP that the store I‚Äôm ordering from allows.  Not even sure how much money I‚Äôve spent on pizza from this company over the years and I don‚Äôt want to go somewhere else but convenience is everything when I‚Äôm looking to feed my family on days that I don‚Äôt have times to cook... I don‚Äôt know why a company as big as Dominos cant fix and/or tailor APP in such a way as other (much smaller) companies have to increase the convenience and ‚Äúquality of reception‚Äù of their product‚Äôs appreciation. It‚Äôs too bad really"
"I love the app! Can‚Äôt even express enough how easy it makes my life. And generally the store closest to our house rocks out our order and gets it to us hot, fast and tasty! Very rarely do I have a negative thought about it, I‚Äôve even given this particular store raving reviews online. Tonight I ordered and was a little disappointed that the smaller pizza box on top of the large had sunken in the cardboard and made the toppings from the large pizza stick to the cardboard. I‚Äôm not too picky so I scraped it off and ate it anyway, but it was disappointing. I wish the app had a place where I could send a note about that to the store, I don‚Äôt want to call and bother people during busy dinner hours but I think they should know so they can avoid this happening again."
"I called Domino‚Äôs to place an order and the never answered the phone in the 15 minutes it took me to drive there. The phone was still ringing when I placed the order in person. The manager acted like it was no big deal that they didn‚Äôt pick up. He said they were busy and just didn‚Äôt have time to answer the phone. Sounds like horrible customer service to me. I called to speak to a higher up - not because no one answered, but because of the lack of concern the manager had - and nothing was ever done. Fast forward and another 10 months (after refusing to do business with Domino‚Äôs because of the experience). It‚Äôs Mother‚Äôs Day and my wife wanted pizza and her favorite is Domino‚Äôs. I call and, you guessed it, no one answered once the automated answering service answered. I was on hold for 10 minutes. To say the least, I was hacked. It appears they only want to do things online, which is what is trending today."
"I am so sick of ordering a Brooklyn style pizza, with no cheese, and then having there be cheese on it when I get to the store, because the employees don‚Äôt seem to consider provolone to be cheese. This is such a ridiculous problem. I don‚Äôt know if Dominos just teaches all of their employees to put provolone on the pizza, even if it says, ‚ÄúNo cheese,‚Äù or if the employees are just that dumb. I feel like it has to be Dominos training them that way. No one is dumb enough to see ‚Äúno cheese‚Äù and think that it still means provolone is fine. You guys have a ‚Äúno cheese‚Äù option, but no ‚Äúno provolone‚Äù option. I‚Äôve dealt with this for years, but tonight was the last straw. I had to sit there for 20 more minutes, waiting for them to remake it, and they didn‚Äôt even so much as offer to give me a discount. The employees even tried to blame it on me.  So, I had to explain to them that provolone is still cheese."
"Most definitely a worthwhile experience every time I order pizza; however, I‚Äôm a truck driver and will appreciate it their is a locations update. Reason being, On Tuesday, June 17th while waiting for to make a delivery in MacClenny, Florida. I used the Dominos app however it said that the location in this city doesn‚Äôt deliver to the Walmart DC in the area. I call the local Dominos- MacClenny, FL directly and they were able to get place my order... so, if anything, please update your city parameter or have locations report which area they receive from Truck Drivers, otherwise, we don‚Äôt call and stop at Walmart Supercenters"
"It makes it so convenient when I‚Äôm busy at work to just open the app, order lunch, and have it delivered down the street. It is rare that I get something I don‚Äôt like. The people are nice, the orders are usually correct, and the location is convenient. The app makes it super easy to order food and it allows me to track my orders process, notifying me when it‚Äôs getting cooked and heading out the door! Getting points for a free pizza doesn‚Äôt hurt either! One suggestion though, if the chocolate lava cakes don‚Äôt actually come with icing, don‚Äôt offer it, charge the customer, and not include it in the order. Otherwise, no complaints here!! Food is great and the app works wonders."
"It try‚Äôs too hard to be unique and that makes it harder to use than it should be. The deals/coupons button is not prominent. And the payment screen it frustrating. Rather then using the credit card scanning feature that is natively supported on iphones it uses its own that doesn't recognize cards with the number on the back. 

Also no Apple Pay. I had gotten a new credit card since the last time I used the app and needed to update it. When apps support Apple Pay you only need to update your card once instead of in every app. Also Apple Pay is more secure. I don‚Äôt trust dominos with my credit card data nearly as much as I trust having it stored locally on my phone and encrypted like with Apple Pay."
"The features on the app make it simple to use and order. One of the features being able to save frequently used addresses that are delivered to and various credit or debit cards, making it faster and easy to order. Another feature that is favorable is being able to track the order and receive updates when the order is complete and the driver is near the destination of delivery. Then there is a rewarding points feature for utilizing the app, receiving points based on ordering over ten dollars earning ten points towards per say a free pizza. Though that does not include extra toppings and the delivery fee. Again, the features on the app are simple to use and can be useful for those who like delivery."
"This is my Domino‚Äôs store that I have to order from when I want pizza. I like domino‚Äôs pizza & I like the deals I get but this location is terrible. Every single time I‚Äôve bought a sauce like hot sauce or ranch it never comes. Once they offered to go back to the store & get it but by the time they got back my food was cold or I would have been finished eating. They‚Äôve forgotten my a drink I‚Äôve ordered twice. Most of the time my pizza isn‚Äôt fresh & taste like its been sitting in a warmer. On two occasions my pizza never came to me, I called the store back after waiting two hours for my pizza to arrive & asked what was going on & they had no customer service saying ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs coming just wait‚Äù then just hung up on me, after I had already waited two hours. I‚Äôm not the type of person to waste my time to write a review or call corporate or anything but it‚Äôs starting to get frustrating."
"Have been using the dominos app for years and have enjoyed it. Recently it has gotten an update which isn‚Äôt bad however when you are trying to get an order in really quick and are use to the old version it isn‚Äôt pleasant. Was placing my order at red lights on my way home and with the new update you have to select your topping then how much of it (normal, double, light, etc). If you don‚Äôt select how much then it doesn‚Äôt go through as you selecting it. In the past if you want less it more you clicked somewhere else. Long story short I got home and  noticed that instead of my 3 topping carry out deal I have a plain cheese pizza :/ still a good pizza but wish my topping selection would have through üò™"
"Everytime I call my local Domino‚Äôs to place an order they aren‚Äôt able to pull up my rewards points to redeem the free pizza. This was an issue the last few months because ham was mysteriously removed from the app even though my local restaurant was NOT out of stock. During this time, in order to redeem my free pizzas, I had to order an all pineapple pizza using the app and quickly call the restaurant to let them know I in fact wanted ham and pineapple. I used to love the ease of the Dominos app and once ‚ÄúHamgate‚Äù happened, I got to experience the lack of communication between the app and my local restaurant. Rewards points accumulated when ordering through the app should also count towards in store and phone orders."
"The only reason I scored this app so low is for the fact I live in Leland, NC. We can‚Äôt order delivery from this app. We have 2 stores again but this app has never worked for delivery no matter what or which store it comes from. I love my Dominos and your my son‚Äôs absolute favorite. Going through the hassle of having to order carry out then calling the store to change it to delivery just so the coupons can be used. Some slacker needs to fix this app asap so not to give costumers the most aggravating and drawn out excursion just to make an order. When this issue is fixed I will then change my rating of this app. If it continues it will be tough cookies for Domino‚Äôs. I will just have to order my pizza else where for now on. Just fix it already, it‚Äôs been years of this app being like this."
"From a feature standpoint domino‚Äôs still sets the standard for other pizza deliveries to follow. However, as a user of a password manager like LastPass for my storage of passwords and credit card data, Domino's is missing the mark on integration with this app. I limit the amount of places I store my credit card info and never save passwords on apps and Domino's is one of a small handful that hasn't embraced LastPass integration with IOS. When attempting to use LastPass the password is not automaticallyfilled and when attempting to copy/paste my CC info the screen changes when you switch back and forth so if you're not fast enough the CC info does not remain in the buffer. 

Taking password managers into consideration would help in keeping things secure while maintaining the general UX of the app"
"I was trying to place an order on the Pizza Hut app. It was ridiculously convoluted and difficult. I got extremely frustrated and thought I would try a competitor. I HATE Papa John‚Äôs, so that ruled those idiots out - period. At that time, I had not had a Dominoes pizza since college. I thought I would give you guys a try. Your app was a breeze! Then I received the food. Yeah, I haven‚Äôt looked back, since!  I love using this app and I LOVE eating your food!!! 

My only suggestion is that you design a way (even if it is a comment option) to make substitutions/additions. I like to add tomatoes to my Philly Cheesesteak. You don‚Äôt have an option to allow people to add such requests. Fix that, please?"
"The app works well for ordering food. The checkout process is met 75% of the time with an error message saying issues processing payment when using a saved to profile CC. I‚Äôve had to add the card from scratch to get it to process the payment. There have been two occasions it ran the card even though I received an error, both times I had two separate pizza deliveries in the same evening. Double the food, double the price, double the headache.

Fix the issue with failed processing payments from a saved CC. Having to renter the card defeats the whole point of saving it to begin with. If you don‚Äôt fix it at least get rid of that option so I don‚Äôt waste time hoping it will work, and then it never does."
"The app works well for most things, but if you make a mistake, it‚Äôs best to cancel everything and start over. And don‚Äôt use the ‚Äòfav order‚Äô feature. Even though you can change things before checkout, sometimes it keeps the old info.

The other issue is more on the employee‚Äôs than the app, but it impacts the app - they don‚Äôt seem very happy with or supportive of the app. They sometimes have difficulty finding the order, and then seem upset that I used it. Sometimes they just have me sign a receipt (I pay via the app), sometimes I don‚Äôt - and some will ask to see the card, ID or both - or none.

This somewhat un-enthusiastic response to app-orders makes it less pleasant to use it at all."
"I believe the app overall is effective, but in my experience there were many errors in trying to place my order. I would click the screen and would need to click it a minimum of 10 times, if not more in order for it to allow me to the next page. I also think it would be helpful if the total of your order could be displayed at the top or even possibly the bottom of the app in an effort to keep track of spending instead of having to proceed to checkout to see your order and possibly need to edit it in order to fit within a specific budget. Lastly, it would be helpful if the user were able to provide specific instructions on every item and not just pizza. I ordered wings and wanted to be able to emphasize that I wanted them firm but there was no place to put that information."
"I love using the app! Fast, secure and I love that I can track the driver when our pizza is arriving closer to our home. However, this is not the first or second encounter I‚Äôve had when using the app. Majority or my orders consist of the 2 for $5.99 deal. With the options given, the stuffed cheesy bread is part of the bundle. When ordering this, it never fails! The price is currently showing on the app at $6.68. I always end up having to call my local store and report which then results in not gained points, to my understanding anyways! This 2 for $5.99 deal needs to be reviewed (all items available for the price) for all customers to ensure that we‚Äôre being charged correctly! Thank you Domino‚Äôs!!"
"Used to be an okay app. Now it asks me if I wanted tracker instead of automatically tracking. And then didn‚Äôt work anyway.  Also my pizza came wrong and there‚Äôs was no way to contact the store through the app. Had to search online for the phone number. The ‚Äúlive chat‚Äù is only to order. Can‚Äôt help you with anything else at all.  It‚Äôs not a live chat at all it‚Äôs a robot for orders. And unless you‚Äôre placing an order continuously says it doesn‚Äôt understand. I‚Äôm in the app.  I‚Äôll just order that way much easier than the unhelpful ‚Äúlive‚Äù chat. Also constantly reverts my payment to my old expired card even though the new one is there to check.  It won‚Äôt let me delete the old one, it‚Äôs always back the next time and the default. Every update I think it will be fixed but not so far. It‚Äôs frankly easier to just call."
I‚Äôm not sure why people have so much trouble with the app. However it would be nice if the site showed what ingredients were on the pizza before you ordered it and how much things were before you clicked on it. I‚Äôm really tired of getting complaints from people when I‚Äôm at work and having to fix the websites mistake. Also it would be nice if you could add sauce to the philly or buffalo chicken when you‚Äôre doing half and half. Those are literally the most common complaints and they have been complaints for the 5 years I have worked at Domino‚Äôs and yet they haven‚Äôt been fixed. Please fix it. Thanks!
"Whether it‚Äôs the persistent popups trying blocking you from accomplishing what you opened the app for in the first place (to order food the way you want it), or the fact that after ordering the app continues to use location services until you fully quit the app, it‚Äôs a horrible experience overall. It‚Äôs only marginally better than picking up the phone to call and even at that ‚Äî it‚Äôs simply that you don‚Äôt have to wait on hold and then pay at the store.

Simplify your app and use more limited targeted popups. Users don‚Äôt need to bashed over the head with the same ‚Äúspecial offers‚Äù over and over each time they order. When you spend as many clicks dismissing popups as selecting your food, you‚Äôre doing this whole app and marketing thing wrong."
"I recently ordered a pizza üçï from them and it was plain cheese and they messed it up because  it was burnt üî• I got it delivered and I called them back and a worker named Brandon came to give me a new free pizza  üçï and he had a very bad attitude he didn‚Äôt say much at all to me and my African American brother he acted like we weren‚Äôt even there like he was above us by ignoring my words like ‚Äúthank you‚Äù I said twice and he COMPLETELY IGNORED me and my AFRICAN AMERICAN brother we are both black and I don‚Äôt usually put rude white ppl off as racist but he really acted there‚Äôs a BIG difference in saying something rudely and not saying anything all and using your body language to do it and he did it VERY, VERY well and got his point across very well but I will say this is a very good app and my first delivery üöö guy was A very kind person  with a GREAT üëç attitude üòä."
"So I have now downloaded the Dominos app on 3 different occasions / 2 different phones. Each time I get an error message that my payment (credit card) is not accepted for ‚Äúgeneric payment error‚Äù. So I try again (card) to make sure I didn‚Äôt type something incorrectly...same thing...so once again I try the PayPal option this time, same thing again! Last attempt I try to pay at pickup...payment error!! How do you have a payment error for pickup?? Let me just tell you that I deleted this app over a year ago at my old address for the same reason then. Uninstalled and reinstalled then and it was the same result, giving them the benefit of doubt I just waited until now.  So now 1.5 years later I give in again... new address, new phone, same credit card...it still doesn‚Äôt work! I give up and back to Papa John‚Äôs!!"
"I ordered a specialty pizza costing me almost $30 and was so excited for it to come. However it never did. The app said it was ‚Äúdelivered‚Äù and I called the store I ordered it from many times in which they kept hanging up or passing me to someone else. I called the next day and the store claims they never even received my order (you get an email saying exactly which store makes your pizza so this was not true). Then I called customer service in which they told me to call my local store, which I told them I had multiple times. After so many calls and hours of trying to figure out how to get my money back or at the least a free pizza, nothing ever came from it. I then contacted customer support multiple times online on their feedback website and included my order # and store and NEVER HEARD BACK. Love dominos but definitely never ordering from the app again wow."
"This is the best Dominos pizza I have ever had. I stopped eating at Dominos years ago because the pizza was not very good and the costumer service was poor at a Tulsa location, so I started going to Papa Jon‚Äôs in Tulsa and Pizza Hut in Okmulgee.  I gave it another try when the Okmulgee location opened and my first experience was absolutely amazing. I am a regular guest now and your pizza blows the competitors away and is so much better! Thank you for making such great pizza and costumer service available in my town! Also, I am an executive chef and have worked in the restaurant industry since 1995, and this is always a surprisingly great experience each and every time! Thanks again! Chef James Price"
"When using a coupon, and in some other instances.... the pricing is not made clear... for instance when using a 50% off coupon for first time app users, no prices were shown... so I don;t know what I‚Äôll pay until I customize my pizza and then go to the checkout cart. Frustrating.

In addition, the app tacks in extra fees and doesn‚Äôt say why... for instance, I had to go through trial and error, but apparently you charge a dollar to change to homemade crust... which is fine, but be transparent and show the fees. If a customer knows ‚Äúthis costs extra‚Äù they can decide to pay it or not, but don‚Äôt hide the fees."
"Had to reenter my info several times. Once I was finally able to place my order there was no place to add a tip for the driver. There was a screen note reminding me to tip the driver when ordering because it‚Äôs contactless. Tried backing up and reviewing the steps to see if I missed the tip box. No. So I made the mistake of falling down the rabbit hole of the CS chat bot. Its answer to a question about the app die ted me to where I could get the app. I tried to connect to a live CS agent but couldn‚Äôt get through the endless bot questions. I resorted to calling the store. There an automated recording directed me to the app. I finally was able to ‚Äúhold the line‚Äù while I waited for the next representative. After 15 minutes waiting, I scrapped the order, deleted the app and then spent 2 minutes ordering Papa Johns from doordash. Great job domino‚Äôs."
"This app does exactly what I want it to: gets me from hungry to pizza as fast as possible. The coupons are offered in a simple, legible list, and then the ordering process takes you directly to the menu items from the coupon. Setting toppings is direct. If you change your mind, it is just as simple to take them off. In-app payment requires your card number only once, or you can pay at the store or upon delivery. The tracker helps to time when to expect it to be done.
The app has been improving, but the login panel does not allow me to paste in the password copied from my password manager app."
"We order from dominos every few months. We would do it more often but they mess up something on our order every time. My neighbor said they have the same thing happen. 
For instance, we ordered two pizzas one with double cheese. They told us in the app that our order was ready but when we got there they had accidentally given one of our pizzas away. So we had to wait what they said would be 20 minutes. It ended up being 45. We get it home and the pics with double cheese that we paid extra for barely had Any cheese. There were spots that the sauce was showing and No cheese at all on them. Never offered an apology a discount or anything. That was the last time we have gone there"
"Everything about ordering through the app simplifies the inconvenience of dealing with interpersonal communication. If you have ordering anxiety which afflicts many people I know this app takes the fear of connecting with another human being and throws it right out the window. Besides the psychological advantages this app also cuts down on user error for order taking and helps delivery the exact culinary experience users are looking for: no more I misheard you in the phone, or you didn‚Äôt say that, or even I never took that order! Finally we can all just let technology  solve our issues and stop dealing with the nuisance of people."
"The only reason it doesn‚Äôt have five stars is because sometimes they mess up the order. My boyfriend and I order Domino‚Äôs a lot, and last night they gave us 2 20oz bottles of water when I requested 2 20oz bottles of sprite. There have also been a few instances where I request 2 sauces (marinara, usually) and I either don‚Äôt get the sauce at all or I only get one. Now this only happens once in a blue moon so I‚Äôm not too upset about it, but I feel it should be addressed nonetheless. I know it‚Äôs not an error on my part because I always always always triple check the order before placing it. I love Domino‚Äôs, so I‚Äôm not going to stop ordering because of this. But I should get what I ask for."
"I am one who LOVES pizza. In the past, I would always stray away from Domino‚Äôs pizza. I used to prefer Pizza Hut if I ordered pizza from a ‚Äúchain‚Äù restaurant. Now, I ALWAYS order Domino‚Äôs pizza. The customer service is wonderful, the quality of the pizza has improved TREMENDOUSLY, and it‚Äôs always ready to go faster than you can imagine. Even when you have it delivered, it comes fast. For example, I ordered my pizza through the app at 8:02pm on a Friday. I received alerts when my order was being made, when it went into the oven and when it came out (8:13pm). I received it at 8:23pm. They have definitely gained a loyal customer out of me over the past year or so."
"The app is great. I especially like the tracker. If I could suggest one upgrade it would be this; add a function that allows people to see what toppings come on each specialty pizza, prior to choosing it.

This could be in the form of a question mark (or something this) on the line where the specialty pizza is listed, that you could tap. Once tapped a small pop up could appear listing the toppings for that specialty pizza.

As it is right now you have to actually go through it like you‚Äôre going to order a pizza, just to see what comes on it. Not very convenient. Anyway, that‚Äôs my 2 cents worth. Keep making hot tasty pizzas for us to enjoy!"
"First off, I imagine I‚Äôm correctly writing this review but I might typo because the text is not showing up in . The app will put priority over the ‚Äúfree pizza‚Äù coupon if you use it when using other coupons and you are wanting to delete the free pizza coupon. I had to deselect my pizza multiple times because I felt the free pizza wasn‚Äôt worth it right now. After that,  tried paying for the pizza and had many expired cards on my profile so after I filled in all the information, it finally told me that I could not add a card because of the amount on my profile. Also, typing all this has been horrible because I keep getting distracted and I literally cannot see what I have typed because the text is invisible during this review process."
"Well not really the beautiful part. I feel like the app could use some visual tweaks to make it a lil more user friendly, but it‚Äôs not enough to take off a star.

The app works great. I love anything that allows me to get to my food without having to talk to a single person the whole time, and this app just about does it (especially with the in-store Kiosks, dang game changer.)

Only thing I find hilariously over-engineered is the process for deleting previously used cards. Instead of swiping it away, you have to select it, then select ‚Äúdelete card,‚Äù then type the word ‚Äúdelete‚Äù to confirm deleting the card. Seems a bit redundant, but it works!"
"So when we first started ordering Dominos, like about 3 or 4 years back, it would deliver to our house. It was like that until the beginning of this year. Yes, I know this review is a little late but hear me out. Anyways, when I went onto the app on my phone to deliver a pizza to our home, it said that it wouldn‚Äôt deliver to us. Like, what??? It worked before, why wouldn‚Äôt it work now? I was immediately confused why this was the case. Over the 8 months, I thought it would change, but NO, it still hasn‚Äôt been fixed. We tried online, also doesn‚Äôt work. Dominos, if you are reading this, probably you won‚Äôt be, PLEASE JUST FIX THIS!!!"
"I saw a post on here which I certainly related to so I will reiterate. It really was a nice feature to be able to see who was making the pizza at the Dominos store. I know as a national franchise, dominos must strive for consistency throughout all of their locations and think that attaching the name of the chef to the order creates accountability, for the cooks who will know their name is directly tied to their product which not only helps in personal online reviews ‚ÄúGreat job Mark!‚Äù But also word of mouth as people could be more likely to order dominoes if they know their best chef is working that night. Overall very high quality ap, experience and food but am going to drop from 5-4 stars after seeing this change"
"Dominos Pizza has become my go to for when we feel like having pizza. With their awesome $5.99 deal, we can get so much food for a reasonable prize. That means that we can get a medium pizza with 2 toppings for just $5.99 and each person can choose to customize their pizza the way they want to! And it‚Äôs so delicious. I also love their chicken Parm sandwich and my whole family loves the chocolate lava cake. And let‚Äôs not forget the cheesy bread, which we order with spinach and feta and is also $5.99. To sum it all up, we get a lot of food for a reasonable price and it‚Äôs all fantastic. Wr ordered pizza yesterday and today. I won‚Äôt order from any other pizza place ever again."
"I live in an area where delivery is not offered so when I dog sit in Logan I always order Dominos. I tried ordering yesterday, Thanksgiving, set my order and waited and waited. After about an hour the Dominos Manager called me personally with an apology about my order and that they were actually closed. Sad day. But I was super impressed he took time out of his personal holiday to tell me he was sorry about the online ordering not notifying me of the location being closed. So I‚Äôm ordering today. My order is in the oven and I‚Äôm more than excited to get my order. That personal touch yesterday means a lot! I‚Äôll always order Dominos first thing, it is the go to for me."
"I do a monthly order for 37 pizzas. Every single time it takes me over an hour to get this done!  You can‚Äôt do this large of an order over the phone. The website can‚Äôt take an order this large; it has you call, which gets you nowhere. I‚Äôve ordered through the app now for 3 months and it takes forever and MANY tries. There is always a network error message and/or the coupons don‚Äôt work. On a few occasions, someone at the location actually called to ensure the large order was legitimate. Each time, they said they would talk to the manager to make this much easier for me. To date, have never received a call back.  I can‚Äôt give up since this is for a homeless shelter.  I just wish this didn‚Äôt take the time it does (and shouldn‚Äôt)."
"This is a great app, very easy to navigate and pleasing to look at! It makes ordering a pizza easy, which is nice. My only complaint is that the address the order is being sent to is not really visible in the ordering process. You can set it BEFORE you make the order, but after placing the order and confirming a name, contact, and payment method, it does not ask you to confirm the address. Additionally, if you add an address that has a suite number to your profile, you can put the suite number when making the address but it is not visible when you select the address to look at it after adding. 

I just think it would make matters more convenient, and ease the minds of all the double/triple-checkers, lol."
"App needs to allow entering amount for tip for delivery driver. Your website does give away to add tip if we go through browser. I just spent time with app picking out and ordering, entering payment information, and looking for way to add tip. No way to add tip. I went to browser then. But I could not even log on this time through the browser. Finally, I looked up number of store, called them, they gave a solution. Before that, I almost quit and cancelled order. But I had just used rewards points. I didn‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd lose those. That also is not clear on your app. So I kept trying. It took a ridiculously long time to place the order because of the lack of a simple option. ."
"It‚Äôs been a year that I‚Äôm unable to finish my orders thru the app because it NEVER processes my payment and it asks me to call the store. I‚Äôve tried different cards, Adding and removing them... it just does not work. 
Tonight I‚Äôm trying to redeem my free pizza and, no surprise, I cannot place my order thru the app. The store is unable to redeem the points for me and tells me to call customer service. Have you tried calling the before? Don‚Äôt bother!
You won‚Äôt talk to a person and they basically just tell you to go to the website and contact then thru there and hung up on your face. 
On the website you can only email them about things. So if you‚Äôre trying to problem solve your order GOOD LUCK! 
After redeeming these points I will not be using their service again. It‚Äôs so frustrating having to go thru this hassle every time I wanna order a pizza. I‚Äôm done!"
Either Dominos needs to figure out how to give you an estimate on delivery or allow you to cancel at some point. The app tracker let us see for the second time out order was in process 1) first time for four hours without an ability to cancel and called multiple times 2)  the order was under inspection for 3 hrs with no ability to cancel and no one would pick up on our calls. We get it staffing is tight but just tell us it is 3 to 4 hrs for delivery and we will adjust or do something different. Now the app doesn‚Äôt appear to allow us to  report an issue either. Timing seems perfect to limit complaints on  slow the service and or their ability to let their customers know the timeline. Pizza was beyond cold on delivery and we had to find a different option for food way beyond it being delivered
"Dominos is for sure one of my favorite places to order from. Food is always done well and delivered quickly. The delivery drivers are always respectful, and when I‚Äôm going in to get food for pick up, they always double check to make sure everything is perfecto.
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND ordering from Dominos. The food is amazing and you have multiple options for sandwiches, wings, and pizzas and also you can get good discounts and coupons from the app itself which is helpful with saving money (have to have an account to get coupons obviously)
Good service. Good food. So here‚Äôs a GOOD REVIEW."
"I stopped eating Dominos oh years ago. Then ordered one after they changed their cardboard crust(sorry guys but it was) and have been a fan since. Other companies don‚Äôt compare not papa john‚Äôs, Pizza Hut.  I have the app on my phone and iPad.  I even gift food to family by adding their addresses. I‚Äôll admit app wasn‚Äôt user friendly because was difficult to go back but if you click on coupon it takes you back, so I use that trick if I forget something. Only real complaint is I can‚Äôt tip in the app so if I gift I either have to call to order or like the first time where I ran over to intercept the driver. Ugh. Fix that! That is inconsiderate to your drivers."
"Your pizzas are genuinely getting better but what keeps me going your competition is the fact that it seems there is almost a growing lack of respect, or an animosity toward Law Enforcement over the last year or so. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the newer, younger management or what but even when off duty, your competitors make us feel very appreciative whereas you guys have literally ‚Äúpushed‚Äù me (us) away and toward your competition (I‚Äôm now a big fan of Papa Johns and Little Ceasars)! I know it‚Äôs a big deal these days to hate and defy law enforcement... that‚Äôs the new trend. UNTIL THEY NEED US! The only reason I‚Äôm ordering from you today is it is my daughters Birthday and she requested you guys... so yes... you get props for your pizza... but even after having many other LEO‚Äôs echo my same assessment, until something changes, I will only do business with you when I must!"
"Unfortunately this is the second time I‚Äôve ordered dominos cheesy bread only to pull up to the window to realize my order didn‚Äôt go through. This is partly a mistake of my own, as I usually order dominos on my way home after working 12 hours. However I would appreciate the ‚Äúyou might also enjoy‚Äù pop up page with desserts being removed, as this leads me to think I have ordered when I have not.  I use PayPal check out for context. Like I said this is probably mostly my mistake and is just a suggestion! Everything else is great. I appreciate the option of using PayPal and the cheese bread is A+"
"My family & I enjoy Dominos Pizza. I‚Äôve used their website to order pizza for years with no issues. However, EVERY time I try to use this app on my iPad, something breaks and prevents me  on continuing my order and I switch back to using the website.

I make sure I have the latest version of the app and I‚Äôm running the latest version of iOS on the iPad. Today, the app couldn‚Äôt finish checking my location to determine my local Dominos location. I even deleted and the reinstalled the app. That time, I got to choosing cheese and sauce on my Build Your Own pizza before getting stuck and not moving forward (next button remains grey and will not continue to the next screen).

Dominos, love your food and I like the UI of your app, but more testing needs to be done for me to use, let alone recommend, your app. Thanks!"
"Great idea but executed poorly. It doesn‚Äôt follow a logical path. Things like deleting a item from your cart should be easy as deleting it from your cart. Also it should give an error msg saying how to do it correctly, not show a error msg saying nutritional information is temporarily unavailable. So to save anyone time that may read this if you can‚Äôt delete an item from your cart you must first delete any coupons it is tied to then delete the item from your cart. The app is supposed to make things easier but I‚Äôve wasted 25 min trying to get my order correct. Gave up and called the store to find out they don‚Äôt have the same deals just to go back to the app for another 10min to figure that out no thanks to any help button or anything. Luckily I love your pizza.... but your app needs work. Hope someone is reading this and does something....thanks if you are"
"Does not work when you do not get what you order.  This app may get you food but will not help if order is not correct.  This app will get you the food that dominos wants to send but not what you order.  This is an online service and you can not eat an email.  If you want a pizza call someone that will care and that is not Dominos.  I ordered pizza with app and came covered in ingredients I can not eat, even though I was very careful to order correctly.  Had to call store after delivery and was told there was no one to talk too.  A local pizza delivery will care if they fail to serve you.  You can order food online with apps just not Dominos.  The good reviews come from people that got what they ordered.  If you are sure you will get every order perfectly prepared use this app.  I prefer to deals with people that care about the food you get; not if it is 8 minutes faster."
"This app is extremely easy to use and makes ordering a breeze. 

My only complaint is that there isn‚Äôt a way to add a tip for the driver. We don‚Äôt always have cash on hand and sometimes they don‚Äôt have the receipt or a pen so you can‚Äôt give them a tip. PLEASE ADD AN OPTION TO GIVE A TIP.

Second change would be to change the color of the text to something other then white because it can be pretty difficult to read with the various eye conditions. A larger font and a different color can really make a difference and allow the customer to see everything clearly. Fix those things and I would give you 10 stars."
"I‚Äôve ordered three times using this app and each time I pay, it said it was an error, and to call the store. The first time I called they said they never got the order so I ordered over the phone. Low and behold, they charged me twice!!! According to the store, in 1-3 business days the extra charge would be returned. The second time same thing, except this time I transferred and had to paid a transfer fee at the bank!!! This last time, we hadn‚Äôt had Dominoes in awhile and forgetting what had happened before placed the order and yet again, error message!!!! This time I called the store and they said they never got my order, so I was done. The manager tried to explain that If you order an odd number of items it does that. WHAT?!?! If I could give no stars I would. My kids were looking forward to it. Oh well."
"Good food‚Äîfare prices‚ÄîA $5 delivery charge that don‚Äôt go to the drivers is nonsense. I understand dominos pays  their delivery drivers $15 an hour which is great . However a billion dollar Company shouldn‚Äôt be profiting on $5 delivery charges that don‚Äôt go to the driver . Making customers offset your expenses so that dominos can have larger profit margins is Horsecrap . I rather the food prices be raised then have a $5 delivery charge. It‚Äôs like going to a gas station and being forced to pay 30 cents a gallon more because they decide to have an attendant. Everyone offers delivery in this modern day and age , very few businesses decide to have these type of tactics ."
"Really do enjoy the app. I‚Äôd like to see it have a pizza tracking function like Papa John‚Äôs but maybe that is something that is in the works. Our pizza‚Äôs have been very spotty on quality as of late. More times than not, they have arrived luke warm to downright cold. Nothing the microwave cannot cure but it can be a disappointment. ALL of your drivers have been awesome, polite and socially distant. How do you tip them with contactless delivery? They work hard for their money and I‚Äôd like to reward this but if I do not sign a receipt nor face to face contact, how do I tip? Would like to see that added to the app as well."
"I was planning on ordering Dominos for dinner and just got fed up with the amount of glitches their app and website had that I ended up ordering Pizza Hut instead. I‚Äôm the type of person who rarely ever leaves bad reviews. I will regularly give a good review, but only leave a bad one if it‚Äôs really, really, bad. 
If you want ranch sauce on your pizza, beware. It will charge you $100. Literally. Some glitch in their system made the upcharge for ranch $100 instead of the $1 or whatever it should be. 
Buttons will randomly not let you click them. For no apparent reason. You want to add that to your order? Too bad. Can‚Äôt click that. 
You want to try to add a coupon? No such luck. If you don‚Äôt add it in the exact way intended, it will glitch on you. 
I have a Masters degree in using technology. This isn‚Äôt a user error. It‚Äôs a poorly coded app."
"Excluding the thin crust pizza options, I can‚Äôt think of a time o have received a delivery with my pizza too burnt to eat. It seems to be a growing concern that receive undercooked, inedible pizzas, with the well done option ticked in the cooking instructions.  Tho it has only happened 3 times in the last year, that really shouldn‚Äôt ever happen. 

This was a review of the app, and the app gets 5 stars, y'all have a great app.  But my local dominos is making me wish I had an option for delivery pizza, on the off chance the competitor doesn‚Äôt ship out pizza that is still dough in the middle of the crust. 

Thanks,"
"I think this app is great and makes ordering pizza a breeze! The only issue that I discovered is that when I open my app, I‚Äôm not logged in, however I can still place an order and use my card that‚Äôs saved to my account. I set up my cart and was ready to buy. I selected ‚Äúsave this order to my favorites‚Äù or something like that (the easy order option) and the app told me to log in in order to save the easy order. However I was still able to see my card info and make a purchase. I don‚Äôt understand how the easy order access is secure but your payment info isn‚Äôt. Other than that, the app is great."
"You need to be very careful when you are you are using the app. It is highly unfriendly and untrustworthy. While you are supposed to be using a coupon for $5:99 for each pizza, you find out without warning that None (I mean None) of the pizzas you selected was really $5:99 thought you tried to stick to the stupid requirements. A pizza for unexplained reasons will be $10:99 and another $7:99 .... 
You realize then that was a silly game and you decide to pick up the phone and call them after you already wasted your time for that crap. The agent on the phone will honor the coupon (unlike the weird app and online site) and give the exact same pizzas without those skyrocketed prices. 
If you want to save your time, don‚Äôt waste it on that crap (the app and the online). Just call them right away."
"First of all Dominos App is Killer on the Road. Ressort for that: When driver prepare order before start driving, and ready to place order 12 minutes before arriving to Dominos store, App suddenly sign out by itself and come into Sign in mode. If driver still want to place order he should drive 70 miles in an hour and time email and long safe password. Most of time he wrongly typed one letter and have start from beginning still driving 70 mil/hour. Wert week bad and danger app. Second: Dominos app can‚Äôt remember sign in information, has not button ‚Äúremember me‚Äù like Papa Johns App and Pizza Hut App. On fhe end Dominos App is way behind Papa John‚Äôs App and Pizza Hut App. Although I am using Dominos App for years, I‚Äôm very disappointed because every time when I try to order pizza I may way from work I put my life in fangs because of such bad App"
"What you see is what you get with Dominos‚Äô app. They make it easy to use coupons, add items and see your total before you purchase. The Pizza Tracker can be hit and miss sometimes but it is helpful to watch where the store is at with building your order. Hungry kids like ours can be a bit more patient before asking ‚Äúwhy isn‚Äôt it here yet?!‚Äù And if they do, I just show the tracker and let them know where the order is in process. Overall, it‚Äôs super convenient and I very rarely call the store anymore unless I forgot to add something or try to make some changes if I messed up (the stores are usually happy to oblige)."
"I love the new flavor Dominos has added to their pizza. This has placed them far above the rest. Pizza is my favorite food- so, I know good pizza. This pizza is even awesome the next day! The powerful punch of select seasoning and quality dough makes Dominos superior. I love the company- they are responsive, progressive, customer focused, clean, well managed and a brilliant star overall! Their website is user friendly, easy to navigate, full of great deals, rewards and pizzazz! Dominos has nailed it! No other pizza company can compare. Stars do what stars do....Shine! Shine on Dominos, I‚Äôm behind you 100% If you haven‚Äôt discovered Dominos yet, try them today. I promise, you won‚Äôt regret it!"
"We order from hear about every week for Friday movie night. They are quick and if they do fall behind they are quickly to resolve it in one way or another.  They are priced right in some areas I wish you would get points due to the amount of food you buy not ten points for one order.  Our family loves the new twisted bread parm and cinnamon twist. Pizzas are fantastic, pasta and sandwiches are lovely too. The only down fall is if there is ever an error they like to give us Dr Pepper and we are not Dr Pepper drinkers we are cola and orange drink drinkers... lol. But hey they are sweet and they work hard. Keep up the fantastic works guys and gals.

Best regards 

Davis family"
"App does what it is designed to do: take orders.  This app is not about deliveries or food quality.  Rather, it is an easy-to-use build-a-pizza and order app.  It remembers all recent orders and you simply hit a ‚Äúreorder‚Äù button to quickly reorder your favorite builds in the future.  Now that i have used the app over several months, it literally takes me 2 minutes to log on, click the version of the pizza we want and move on.  The pizza is at the store for pick up by the time I get there (12 minute drive).  To make matters even better, there is a rewards system.  So, it‚Äôs nice to get a free pizza every now and then (I don‚Äôt keep track of points so it‚Äôs always a happy surprise LOL!)"
"I used this app a lot for the rewards program, and now I use the mobile ordering even more since COVID restrictions in my town. You can select all items from the menu and indicate the specific bread, meat, toppings and sauces. I love how you can even indicate whether you want the regular amount or if you‚Äôd rather have more of a topping or less of the amount. You can also add on ‚Äú make it a meal‚Äù or side items individually. It is great that after you make an item you can select it as a favorite and put a name on it. This makes it easier the next time you are ordering for a family you just go to your favorites and you can find all your items already built to suit for each person. Additionally, you automatically earn points toward your reward tokens with later turn into cash rewards toward your purchase. The only downside the the rewards is that they do expire so don‚Äôt forget to use them. Last perk...well you can skip the line of course. It indicates what time your order will be ready and you can skip the line and go to the register to pick it up. Your all done because you already payed online. Great app!"
"Especially compared to the competition (places like Taco Bell, Sonic, Pizza Hut, and Starbucks, which all have excellent apps), I find this app to be buggy and inconvenient. Adding toppings and sauces to subs is more cumbersome than it should be and I usually experience a lag when trying to remove toppings. The options online often don‚Äôt match up with the store. Salt apparently isn‚Äôt an option using the app, although pepper is? Maybe the issues lie with my local Subway‚Äôs inventory, but I also can‚Äôt select chip options that I know they have in store. There‚Äôs no way to specify what kind of fountain drink you want if you add it as a stand-alone item (can only specify if it‚Äôs part of a meal). As a result, I have to use the special request section to correct my order since it isn‚Äôt accurate and even then I just end up having to grab everything myself when I get to the store. Also, ‚ÄòMake it a meal?‚Äô shows up for subs but not for personal pizzas, even though every Subway I‚Äôve ever gone to offers up the option of making my pizza a meal. Had to try adding my credit card about 4 times before it finally saved it (even though I didn‚Äôt change any info  from the first attempt to the last... it was just being buggy). Buggy and slow when trying to remove items from the cart. Finally, it‚Äôs probably human error somewhere in the process, but the tracker often won‚Äôt register that I‚Äôve picked up my order, so I‚Äôll see a reminder on the app homepage saying I have an order ready."
"So I already had problems from the start of my desire to order my subway sandwiches from one store for curbside pickup and was told when I called there that they had to cancel my order because Covid showed up with two of their staff and they couldn‚Äôt give me my order. I totally get that and was sorry to hear they were affected and pray they‚Äôll get through it unscathed. So I asked if they could forward it to another store and they said know. So I placed an order at another store on my way home. When I got there there was no one in the store and the young man started my order from what I could tell and completed it and put it to the side because a family walked in along with a female employee. I‚Äôm in parking lot watching this. So she joins him to help with family order but I‚Äôm wanted to get going tsp I called to ask about my order and she answered the phone. I told her I was ready for my order to pickup. She said, ‚ÄúJust wait a hot minute‚Äù and proceeded to hang up on me. I feel I had ordered way before the family walked in and should have mine completed and delivered first before starting in another. Then I get home and my sandwiches were not prepared according to what I had ordered. Very disappointed. Don‚Äôt appreciate the disrespect either. I was nice when I called, didn‚Äôt deserve it. Won‚Äôt go there again!"
"Placed an order at 5:20pm on the app for pickup at the Menominee, MI Subway. Completed the transaction and it told me it would be ready for pickup at 8:20pm. Three hours?!!! Called the store 20 minutes later to see if was really going to take that long. They haven‚Äôt gotten the order! She said it usually takes 15 minutes for the store to receive it. So they should have already gotten it. She said once they received the order that they would have it ready in 15-20 minutes. I called back in 25 minutes and they still hadn‚Äôt received the order! She asked me to give her my order over the phone and they would make it right away. I went to the store 20 minutes later and showed the woman my phone with the order details which show date, time, order number, store number, location, items ordered, amount paid, method of payment. Everything to prove it‚Äôs legit. I appreciate the employees willingness to resolve things, but the app is COMPLETE GARBAGE!!! The store had no way to look up my order, no way to cancel the order, and no familiarity with the app itself. They made my verbal order with one error, by forgetting to put bacon on my steak & bacon sub, which is a little frustrating. The app far outweighed the missing bacon in terms of visceral frustration. And on the Subway website under the Contact Us section, you don‚Äôt have an option to choose app problems or feedback. I‚Äôd rate the app zero stars if that was an option."
"The app in itself is pretty good save the fact that it‚Äôs not crystal clear how to apply the deals to an existing order. However that‚Äôs not the reason why I‚Äôm writing to you. I just downloaded the subway app about a week ago, and I have used it four times so far. The first THREE orders had missing items and not just simple items I mean like the missing guacamole in the turkey bacon GUAC wrap. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è luckily we live in walking distance so I just walk back to fix the order. Now the fourth time is the kicker and it is pretty much the sole reason why I will never ever use your subway app again. I dialed in the order and it gives me the ready time of approx. 15 minutes. Totally fine. I show up at the approx. time and it‚Äôs one person who just showed up to their shift for that night and has no idea where my order is. He spots the ticket order on the counter and is confused why no one has taken care of it since it‚Äôs been 15-20 minutes since that ticket order has been ordered and PAID through your app. Apparently your (probably way underpaid minimum waged) prior shift employee grabbed the ticket, set it on the counter, and clocked out without even communicating to the next shift employee about it. I‚Äôm giving your app a one star not because your app is insufficient but because you failed to realize that you expect your franchise to employ competent persons to execute orders that is generally meticulous in nature."
"I just signed up and it was pretty painless. I‚Äôm typically very frustrated by the time I‚Äôm finished unless I Chuck my Phone out the window before I‚Äôm done.   The application/ sign up process was  easy. Ordering sandwiches was a step by step process and the pictures make it easy to follow. I forgot to order my choice of cheese but in the checkout yiu have one last chance to add or subtract items. Also the locations chapter was easy to follow and subway allows Apple Maps so I‚Äôm not forced to download another map app I don‚Äôt necessarily want, thanks for that consideration. To summarize; my lengthy review; signing up is breeze  just read the instructions & follow the steps. If you‚Äôre not on your own turf Locating a store is a cinch if you know where you are. If you don‚Äôt know where you are it‚Äôs likely you need more than a sandwich.  I found this app to be problem free. Besides there really isn‚Äôt a Cadillac problem that can‚Äôt be fixed with a stomach full of Subway is there?  Slow your roll (wheat , Italian, or artisan lol couldn‚Äôt help it ) slow your roll you‚Äôll be unwrapping that delicious 12 inches of Yummy in no time. Cant eat the whole thing? Wrap in some plastic and BAM! Lunch tomorrow cuz its stays fresh even overnight. You‚Äôre welcome,  k&g Henson Murrieta Ca"
"Are used this app about three days ago and it worked fine. I was able to go to my recent orders and replace the same order without any problems. Then I upgraded the app. When I tried to use it today I was unable to re-order one of my orders from previous days. I had to start an order from scratch. When I got to the subway restaurant about 20 minutes after placing my order, they could not find my order then they found his body had a hard time because they did not find my name on the order even though I had placed the order using my Subway account with my name on it. Now I am trying to test the app again and I get a screen that says I need to update it when I press the green update button at the bottom of the screen nothing happens. I went to the App Store to download the update but I am having the same problem. When I open the app, I get that same screen that says that an update is needed and it‚Äôs giving me an option to press the green buttonTo update, but that button is unresponsive. What is happening?"
"I placed an app order at my local Subway Sunday evening at 8:40pm. Store hours online said they were open until 9pm and the app showed them available for taking orders. Placed an order and got a message from the app saying my card was charged, the order was confirmed and would be ready shortly. I went to the location (verified twice) and the store hours on the door said they closed at 8. No big deal, hours change, but then why did the app allow the order, confirm, and charge for it? 

So, I went in to the store today, showed them the order (which the app still lists as pending),  explained the issue, figuring since the order was shown as paid, they could simply make good on it now. I was told that they couldn‚Äôt make food for that order, that I would have to order again and dispute the previous charge with my bank!!  I just did and got my money back, thankfully. 

I also tried contacting Subway directly before my bank, but their 800 number would only tell me (by recording) to report app issues on the web site. Clicking ‚Äúhelp‚Äù in the app takes you to that same site, and the answer to ‚Äúhow to report an issue‚Äù on the site says to click ‚Äúcontact us‚Äù under ‚Äúhelp‚Äù in the app, but no such option exists. There‚Äôs literally only ‚Äúhelp‚Äù which takes you to the web site which says to report in the app‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.."
"I would give a 0 star rating if I could. The app wouldn‚Äôt was not working at all about 1 month ago while visiting one of my local Subways to pick up a sandwich at the end of a long day! The clerk/server ringing up my purchase did his best to scan the App to apply/redeem my points to no avail. As I happen to carry the card that came before the App with me as well, he tried to swipe the card (which has always worked before) and the end results was a total lockout of my account with the message to contact Subway. I had to make the purchase without my points! I did contact Subway the next day and after several minutes, the customer service rep found the solution to my problem. Problem solved; hardly! Two weeks later, I went to buy three sandwiches at one of my local Subway locations. This time out, the App just kept spinning and spinning as if it was prepping to open. It never did! Thank goodness my old card worked this time out. A couple of days after, I tried to open the App at home just to see what would happen. It opened up without a hiccup. Gee Subway, I need the App to work when I am actually interested in ordering food, NOT when I am just sitting at home not interested in eating your food that day. I expect to have a helpful, functioning App at the time of purchase instead of a message to contact you guys, or to simply not have the App open at the moment of truth! Frustrating!!!!"
"The app is convenient when it works.  I say that because so often I go through the pains of buying online and I get to the end and get an error. This happens frequently. I resubmit, start over , etc. same stupid error message. And there is no one to call and ask for assistance. I keep the app current on my iPhone. The next day it may or may not work again. I also think going through the menu is slow and clumsy. 

I also try to get my order straight in advance so when I am ready and I hit the purchase button I know it will be fresh. This is typically the time I am hurried and do not want to step through the menu. But I still want Subway Fresh, right. But today something changed and when I went back to my order to submit payment it appeared to be missing. So I ordered all over again and then noticed I had two subs in the queue. So I had to figure out how to cancel one of them. My order changed slightly and I couldn‚Äôt tell which one I was canceling. 

So what is my reward for continuing to use the app and buy from Subway. There is none. No rewards for buying your subs 3-4 days a week. No extra discounts. No buy 4 get the 5th free. Nada. And I don‚Äôt expect anyone will respond to my input. So Surprise me, Subway."
"First I placed an ordered for delivery. Upon arrival I received one out of three sandwiches and the one I did get wasn‚Äôt correct at all. I looked to see if there was a way I could fix this through the app and there wasn‚Äôt. This was the beginning of my problems. I then called the store as directed by their page and was met with the most rude and incompetent person. She refused to cancel it/refund it saying there was nothing she could do. When I asked for a customer support number she said she didn‚Äôt know, when I ask okay how do we fix this? She stated in the most annoyed tone ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, I can‚Äôt do anything‚Äù when I asked for a manager she said I kid you not, ‚Äúoh I don‚Äôt know‚Äù are you serious? When asked for her NAME she said she didn‚Äôt know. Eventually I just hung up and was going to dispute it with my bank but she did call me back and suddenly was magically able to cancel the order. The second time I attempted to use the app, I placed an order on the app for pick up this time attempting to avoid the same issue, the order stated it went through and they where ‚Äúworking‚Äù on it. However when I arrived the place was completely empty and closed!!! Not a single employee in there. How the app allowed me to place an order is beyond me. I had to dispute the charge with my bank since I couldn‚Äôt even call and corporate is a joke. Over all screw subway, NEVER AGAIN."
"I placed my order in the app but when it came time to pay the app gave me an error message and asked me to try again. I did so. Then it gave me another error and said my cart had expired, create a new cart. I closed the app, relaunched the app, tried again and had the same problems. I finally gave up and called the store directly. After placing my order over the phone, I thought to check my email. Sure enough, there were two messages waiting for me confirming my orders from the app. I checked with my bank app and guess what? Subway had charged me three times! Two times from the app and once from the over the phone order. 

As I was looking at this information, the store called me back. Thankfully they noticed a duplicate order. What‚Äôs that you say? A single duplicate order? That‚Äôs right‚Ä¶ Only two of the three orders showed in their system. Some thing was definitely not working right. The store was only able to cancel one order and is going to wait an hour or two to see if the third one shows up in their system and will void it at that time. 

What a horribly, unreliable app. And for people who don‚Äôt catch the extra charges on their bank account right away, a horrible inconvenience to have to call the bank and try to prove that these charges should not have existed in the first place."
"I am unable to order from any of the Subways around me using this app. I can only use it for the subway by my brother‚Äôs house. Also every time I order extra sauce it comes as light sauce. I originally thought this was a worker error, but it happened for months on end. I finally switched to ordering the regular amount of sauce and I get way more sauce now(still not heavy unfortunately.) I have also had several instances of ordering the buffalo chicken sub, but buffalo sauce is not an option so it came as plain chicken even though I paid more for buffalo. Despite my complaints Subway is absolutely delicious and it‚Äôs awesome to order through your phone instead of in store. I would order far more often if the Subways by my house were compatible(I can‚Äôt understand why they aren‚Äôt). I also once had an order that never made it to the restaurant which caused a series of inconveniences that ended with me spending over an hour in the store and eventually ordering manually. The inexperienced worker was very understanding about it despite how slow he was and slammed the restaurant was. He tried to call the manager for help who did not answer. Why the manager left a new kid all alone for a rush was beyond me."
"I ordered and picked up an order though this app on 7/23 and didn‚Äôt seem to have any issues. Two hours later, the store called me to tel me that my order needed to be picked up! I had already done so! Much to my chagrin, there was a different order - two sandwiches instead of the three I ordered. I thought it would be simple and the store would cancel the order - NOPE!!! The manager said they didn‚Äôt get any money for the sandwiches and they could not stop the pending charges or reverse them so I would have to submit an online request for reimbursement because I used this app - but wait it gets better - I submitted my request that day and waited patiently for a response, but on the eighth day I called corporate. Corporate told me that they would do anything for me either and I had to take the time to dispute the charge with my own bank:/! I was told this subway is a franchise and therefore not part of the subway corporation?!?!?! Best part is I‚Äôm the only on that is out of luck - the franchise and the corporation still have my money!!!! The lack of support and customer service has been appalling. I have now spent my time disputing this charge with my bank. Subway you have really dropped the ball on something that could have been so easy to correct ON YOUR END! BEWARE OF USING THIS APP! Shame on your practices Subway."
"I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs up with this app but it keeps changing my name to my husband‚Äôs name but as soon as I go under account and click on ‚Äòname‚Äô it clearly shows my name then changes the name back to mine.  It caused a problem today when I ordered online for pickup. My husband went to pick it up and they claimed it didn‚Äôt go through. Then I go in and show them the order number and they claim it was never received by them and they suggested I reorder in person and pay again. Upset, I leave. Upon getting home, the app shows my order is ready for pickup so I call the store again.  They claim they still hadn‚Äôt received the order and that it must be an automated notification.  Three hours later I receive a call from said subway asking if I am going to pick up my order as it has been hours since it was ordered online. I tell the person they must be joking because I was there hours before trying to pick it up when they said it didn‚Äôt exist. It was apparently under my husband‚Äôs name somehow.  You would think they would have asked my husband if it could have been ordered under his name somehow but neither of us even thought about that. You would also think when she asked me for my order number something would have showed up in their system.  Worst experience ever."
"I'm not one to write reviews but This is getting old... This app is still terrible even after the updates. Twice now I have attempted to order and it says ""something went wrong please erase your cart and try again"" or something like that. One time I completely gave up and went somewhere else only to get a call asking if I was coming to pick it up. The staff was nice enough to keep it on record as an I owe you and redeemed that later. Another time I tried a second time to get the order to go through as the directions stated and when I went in to just order it the normal way they stated the order went through twice and one ticket had 3 meals ordered. I only told it to order one meal a time.. Get this SH@$ working already.. This is going on over a year for Subway having an epic failure of an app. Keep saying they fixed it with every update... Do you even use our test the app? Someone isn't doing there job right. I'd feel pretty miserable if I was in charge of application development! Hope they're getting paid well for nothing! Almost every other food ordering app from other places has a 4 plus most over 4.5 plus rating... I think it's time you take a look at how they are doing it. Maybe throw up the white flag and call for help.. You literally have nothing to lose. Rant over."
"I‚Äôm a big fan of eating at Subway because of how much you can customize things. This app doesn‚Äôt let you do that nearly as much. Items like the Steak & Cheese don‚Äôt give you the option to select a Footlong, which is frustrating because Subway currently has an offer of $5 footlongs if you order 2 on the app, which this prevents me from taking advantage of. Entire menu items are completely missing from the menu as well, like the Ham and Turkey sandwich. Also, other ingredients, such as bell peppers, are completely missing from the Customization page; but when I go into the local store in-person, they have them in stock. 

I also sometimes like to add other meats to existing menu items, but the app only allows Pepperoni, Bacon, or Guacamole as custom add-ons. I know from working at a Subway restaurant in the past that it is just as easy to add items like Salami, or almost anything else, onto an order; yet the app doesn‚Äôt allow that.

All in all, these issues with this app have prevented me from being able to order what I want from Subway via app. The Subway website has all the same problems. During this pandemic, that means I cannot order from Subway at all."
"I have a subway right across from my job, we were pretty busy so I ordered food through the app so I can just pick it up and go back to work. However, the app threw my order to a subway that wasn‚Äôt near me. So when I went to the subway across the street, the cashier said she had not received any mobile orders all day. I showed her the app and confirmation and we said that the address wasn‚Äôt this location but for the subway down the street. Already agitated I just had them do the order there and I paid. I called the subway where my order was placed thanks to the app and they said they couldn‚Äôt cancel it because only the manager knew how.  I called the next day and spoke to the manager (Ignacio) and explained the situation to which he said ‚Äú I don‚Äôt know why the staff didn‚Äôt call me to explain the cancellation process because now it‚Äôs too late to do it.‚Äù He did offer store credit to which I refused because that location is not near me plus I had already bought the sandwiches  again from the subway across my job. The manager said he would call me back in a few minutes and of course two days later I have yet to receive a call. I disputed the charge through my bank, deleted the subway app and am never going to subway again. Thanks Ignacio for being so unprofessional and unhelpful."
"Today I placed an online order for a what‚Äôs considered a spicy Italian sandwich and I‚Äôm aware that it takes up to 24 hours to load you points but something wasn‚Äôt right. Hours after getting my sandwich I went in the app and it read,‚Äù it wasn‚Äôt  able to add my points‚Äù, so I checked my email to make sure it confirmed that I purchased it. In which they sent my confirmation, but the app continued to say an error occurred while trying to retrieve points. So I clicked the scan icon to see if anything would happen, and once I clicked it. Actually every time I clicked the icon the subway app would disappear, and it would go to my home page. So I checked my WiFi to see if that was the problem which it wasn‚Äôt, and then I logged out. Once I did that it, the app said its performing maintenance on their registration process. That‚Äôs just makes me upset because I don‚Äôt know if this maintenance is going to cancel the  points I already have and on top of that I never got my points from the order I just purchased. There is no history of my purchase on the app (before logging out) because there was an error. So if I could be helped out I would really appreciate it. Also on top of that this was my first time using your mobile order, so this experience makes me skeptical of ever using it again."
"If you use different subway locations (you travel for work), it will sometimes revert back to the location from your previous order. I was in Highlands Ranch, Colorado making a delivery (I‚Äôm a trucker) not 200ft from a location. I changed the location in app to that store. As I placed the order it reverted back to the previous order location in Longmont, Colorado from 3 weeks earlier and sent the order to that store. When I got the confirmation email I noticed the mistake and called that store to explain to them what happened. The store manager told me ‚Äúit‚Äôs an electronic payment and there‚Äôs nothing she could do‚Äù. I asked her not to make the sandwich as I wouldn‚Äôt be able to drive 2hrs with traffic for a $7 sandwich. 
I contacted subway through the email I found on the app and they responded with each store if individually owned and there was nothing they could do. So I was charged the money anyway. I know it‚Äôs not much money but if it happens to even 1% if the people that use the app it‚Äôs a lot of money subway if profiting for nothing. It‚Äôs a simple fix that they need to do. 
If you only ever use one location it‚Äôs a great app but if you use multiple locations for lunches at work or something it‚Äôs not worth the time you‚Äôd save. I‚Äôm deleting the app and subway isn‚Äôt in my lunch rotation anymore."
"THANKS to Subway phone tech support, we figured out what the issue might have been.
I'm running iOS version 12.4.1 on my iPhone. I was impressed when the support person with whom I spoke actually knew how to turn on VoiceOver, and try the app using it with his phone. He was running iOS 13.3, and I heard the app working as it should, getting past the first screen. He also had a coworker try it with iOS 13.3 on an older phone.
So, we arrived at the solution that I would update my iPod Touch, and see if I can get past the first screen with it. When I tried that the next day, sure enough, it did work!
And now, for whatever reason, it's again working on my phone at iOS 12.4.1, too, when the other day, I could double tap until the cows come home, and it wouldn't go anywhere past the initial screen.
MANY THANKS Subway tech support! You've restored some of my faith in app developers and tech support people who actually have an interest in app accessibility!
THANK YOU AGAIN!
The original review text from a few days ago is below, but I consider this issue definitively resolved for the time being!

ORIGINAL REVIEW TEXT, which no longer applies:
How can I redeem my rewards, when I can‚Äôt even get past the first screen? Please, please fix this before January 31, 2020! If not, I have no way to use my four dollars reward that expires by then.! Thank you most kindly for your attention!"
"*Edit* this is the worst of the food apps i use. Rarely does it work when i want it to. And of course why would the restaurant uphold the coupons that the app offers? That would be too convenient to the customer. Customer service is as rare as a unicorn these days.   

Im only leaving this review based of a recent experience I had using the app. I ordered a sandwich from a local subway shop, I got a call almost instantly saying that they were out of almost everything, at that point why they were still even open I dont know, so I obviously didnt want any other sandwich of the two bad options I had with what they had left, so I asked them to cancel the order, and the employee said there is no way to cancel the order on their end‚Ä¶‚Ä¶so what are we suppose to do when this happens??? They offered me another sandwich but i did not want another one and then they said I could pick up a sandwich tomorrow‚Ä¶but I dont want the sandwich tomorrow. Now I have to deal with this during work in order to talk to the manager and possibly corporate subway to get this figured out. Subway is quickly going downhill and its sad to see."
"There is always always always an issue with this app. I know that there‚Äôs another bread available when I go in the store. It‚Äôs the 9 grain honey oat. I only saw that option once on the app. The buffalo sauce was unavailable for a couple of months (except for the buffalo chicken sandwich was the only way to get buffalo sauce on this app). That issue is fixed now. BUT NOW, I ordered today and there was no possible way to get the bread toasted. The toasted option wasn‚Äôt there. Only on the artisan flatbread was the only one with the toasted option. So on the ‚Äúspecial instructions ‚Äú I put the word TOASTED 3 times all in capital letters. And guess what, my sandwich was stone cold and not toasted at all. The egg whites came straight out of the refrigerator. I don‚Äôt want cold eggs. And it would be nice to have ALL of the seasonings available. Sometimes there‚Äôs only one available, sometimes there‚Äôs 4 available. Even if there‚Äôs 4 it still doesn‚Äôt display them all. There‚Äôs always an issue with this app. There were times I bought cookies and chips and I didn‚Äôt receive them. I don‚Äôt think I ever had a smooth experience with this app. I only still use it because I like subway."
"app popped up with a message asking if I was ""enjoying"" It after using it for less than ten minutes. It took all of those ten minutes to get through the glitches so it would actually allow me to order, so I said no, I wasn't. The next pop-up was the most condescending ""Oh no! Do you want to tell us more?"" I've ever seen. I hit yes, thinking it would take me, like.... anywhere. Here, maybe? To a form that you can submit on their website or through their app (if you can get it to work long enough to find it)? 

Nope! It asked if I wanted to call them. The ONLY option it gives for feedback about a bad experience is calling and talking to someone on the phone. What year is it?? I get that it took them four years longer than any other fast food joint to actually have an app in the first place, but surely, *surely* they aren't only giving that option for frustrating experiences because they know very few people will actually call, right? That can't possibly be it. Sure, there is literally no reason to *only* have a phone option in the year 2020 for a major fast food joint, but.... okay, there's no but. So hey, congrats! A one star review and a rant, just like you really didn't want me to ‚ó°Ãà"
"where to even start? i have no idea how the app has 4.8/5 starts because every time i try to use this app, i run in to NUMEROUS issues to the point that i give up and usually end up getting food elsewhere. it‚Äôs slow, and doesn‚Äôt even work half of the time. when it does, i encounter error after error. it asks you to confirm your order location approx FOUR separate times during the ordering process, you cant use a gift card unless the balance covers the entire order total (cant split between a debit/credit card and gift card - so dumb) and editing your sandwich is so lengthy and unnecessarily difficult. setting a payment method is a nightmare and again, i don't think you can even use a gift card loaded to the app in person at a subway unless it covers the whole total???? the app also shows pop up ads CONSTANTLY  throughout the ordering process which is just annoying and a nuisance. takes you to the final order page after every item you add - also annoying - and it‚Äôs so tedious to try and edit an item added to your cart. overall the WORST experience i have had using any app ever, not just food wise. do better subway."
"I placed an order on the app an hour in advance and realized that it was at the wrong location. The app doesn‚Äôt allow you to cancel an order, to do so you would have to contact the restaurant. I called them and they said that they haven‚Äôt received the order and they hung up in my face. I called back and the guy said that he checked the orders and mine hadn‚Äôt shown up. He asked what time i placer the order for and I told him 8:15pm as it was about 7:20 pm. He said (with the rudest attitude) to call back closer to the order time to cancel. I said I would and I placed an order for the correct location. I called them at 8:05 pm and nobody answered. I called them at least five more times with no answer. I decided to go to the restaurant and handle it inside. It took 30 minutes to get to the front of the line and the girl couldn‚Äôt do anything. I was extremely late for work waiting on that line and I HAD to take the sandwiches. They were prepared incorrectly on top of all of it and I still had to pick up my order at the correct location. I‚Äôve never know an app not to have a cancel option. This is ridiculous and I want a refund. Never using this app again. It was a complete waste of time and money"
"I tried to place an order with a coupon. Turns out the coupons aren‚Äôt accepted at my local subway. That‚Äôs fine. But the order said it‚Äôd be ready for pickup at 9:30 PM which was HOURS after I placed the order. I called the Subway and told them I wanted to cancel that order and that the app said it would be ready at 9:30 PM. They said no order came in. So I said that‚Äôs fine but I don‚Äôt want the order if it does. Unfortunately there‚Äôs NO way to cancel orders from the app. Here I am at 10 pm getting angry calls from Subway saying hey come pick up your food, we‚Äôre trying to close. I explained to them that I called and canceled hours ago but no order was showing. So when my order finally showed up they made it and charged me. I told her I wanted a refund which at first she wasn‚Äôt going to give me. Eventually they decided to refund my money. I‚Äôm not mad at the subway because it‚Äôs the app‚Äôs fault for not having a cancel option. I imagine after hours they had done forgotten about my phone call and fulfilled the order not thinking anything of it. Either way, I‚Äôm deleting the app. If my local Subway isn‚Äôt going to utilize the coupons advertised, there‚Äôs no real incentive to keep it anyways."
"This app would be great for big orders ‚Äúwhen‚Äù it works. I took 30 minutes to put in a very large order. It said it went through and a pick up time. Came at the pick up time and found out that it had been voided. Called the bank and found out that they charged us for the order. 10 minutes later Subway voided the order from the bank too, nothing to do with the bank. Had to then get in a long line and re order our large order. What a waste of time! Called the 800 number they don‚Äôt care and told me it‚Äôs on the specific store side. All I got back from the store was a already formed email that they send to every customer who has an issue. Not ever using this app again. Waste of my time! No one cared to tell me how this can be avoided again or if I use the app again if this would happen again?!? If I want to make a large order I will go somewhere else that cares to have my business."
"Subway doesn‚Äôt update the app! 
Food items are still listed even though they have been removed from the menu. 
Also, local store inventory is not in sync between corporation so the app doesn‚Äôt know if they have items in stock or are temporarily out... so if your lucky you will get a call from the store location telling you they don‚Äôt have what you ordered or the items not on their menu and you have to give them a replacement order over the phone on the spot. Or you get to the store expecting to pick up your order only to find out they don‚Äôt have the items and you need to make your sandwich/s anyway. 
And... that doesn‚Äôt take into account the possibility the price of what you then order for replacement is a lower price then the original order but that‚Äôs just to bad, because you already paid the price for the higher items so you‚Äôre expected to ‚Äúeat‚Äù the difference in price because you ordered and paid online on the app! So that‚Äôs just to bad for you... convince comes at a price and we definitely pay that price with subway... if you like gambling then this is your app... you roll the dice every time order..."
"i‚Äôve used this app for a very long time and I always run into problems when ordering. Right now the app is saying I have rewards that have expired and that I need to click manage settings or something when I don‚Äôt have any rewards on there so the option to manage them won‚Äôt even pop up now I wanted to get food before I go to work and I‚Äôm not able to do that because it‚Äôs not able to process my order without me removing something that can‚Äôt be removed. It should have an automatic reset if there‚Äôs no rewards, instead of making you manually remove them, the system takes it off for you it‚Äôs ridiculous how many times I‚Äôve had to go through this
also I hate how if I accidentally click a different link it‚Äôll have to restart the whole page with the logo in the white background (ex: accidentally pressing the map link on the app and having to wait for the previous page to reload when it should not be that complicated)
I love subway really but this app is just terrible and needs tons of work."
"So I was testing out the app and accidentally placed an order, It didn‚Äôt really give me a confirmation to make sure that I didn‚Äôt accidentally hit the place order button, second of all I followed the steps to try to cancel which was only to call the store that I made the order from which I did and the store manager said they had canceled my order and that I should receive my refund, however I looked at my bank statement and realized i was still debited, so I called the same store back and they said there wasn‚Äôt anything they could do about it and that I‚Äôd have to go to the website. So I went through the website and it didn‚Äôt even have an option for any issues of such, cancellations. So I had to just try and contact them and send them a note and still haven‚Äôt received anything. So now I most about $20 and no food even. I hope they have a better way of resolving this typical issue otherwise I highly don‚Äôt recommend this app especially if you have a kid or someone that might accidentally push the place order button when you aren‚Äôt actually ready to.."
"Updated: heard back before I had to go through my credit card company and they are refunding the purchase. Still hesitant to trust the hours in the app going forward though

Ordered a sandwich through the app for a restaurant that was supposed to be open until midnight (according to the app), received my confirmation email, arrived at the store at 10:55 and it was very clearly closed (with hours posted as open until 11:30pm). Couldn‚Äôt cancel the order since the only way to do that is by calling the restaurant who obviously didn‚Äôt pick up. Only customer service contact is a form, so filled it out explaining what had occurred and asking for confirmation I wouldn‚Äôt be charged. Four days later my credit card has been charged and I have no response from customer service, looks like I‚Äôm going to have to deal with this through my credit card company. Clearly deleting the app as it defeats the purpose of ordering ahead if the restaurant might not even be open and they charge you for food you don‚Äôt receive"
"A week ago, my app froze and a box keeps coming up saying A problem occurred CONTACT SUPPORT or SIGN OUT‚Äù
If you ‚Äúcontact support‚Äù it takes you to a website with only options that are irrelevant to the issue. I ended up going to the desktop site, where I could sign in but when I check my rewards it says ‚ÄúERROR please try again‚Äù. 
I literally go to subway seven days a week and accumulate a ton of points and redeem them one at a time when they‚Äôre about the expire. I‚Äôve used this app since it came out two years ago. But suddenly now it froze and I cannot do anything. I have a gift card connected to it and $28 worth of accumulated points that I cannot access. I‚Äôve gone to the main website and filled out a form under ‚Äúapp issues with apple phone‚Äù three times in the last week and have heard nothing back. I deleted the app and reinstalled it but the error still comes up. The only way to use it again is to sign up for a new account back at zero. 
If ANYBODY has information on who I can actually get a response from someone, please post here. Ridiculous!"
"I used to eat at Subway every week at least twice. The app was extremely convenient for me to order and it be in the process of being made while I was driving over to the location.
Eventually, every attempt to make an online pickup order for the past year has not worked for me. Oftentimes, it simply denies submitting my order right as I go to check out. When this first started happening, I would just submit my order over the phone. When they made it against company policy to put in phone orders for pick up, I stopped going because I was deterred of standing in line during the pandemic.
I went months not visiting subway because of these issues. I just tried the app for the first time again today, and it failed to complete. Thankfully the cashier allowed a phone order this time. 
Hopefully they figure out the app issues eventually. With how Covid is, if I am denied doing over the phone, I'll have to go back to not even going here. I really love subway, and I want them to sustain through this pandemic."
"Here‚Äôs a thought...McDonald‚Äôs has Curbside Parking signs with numbers on them so when you order curbside from the app, you pull into an available spot and put that number on the app.  When your order is ready, they ( the McDonald‚Äôs employee ) will bring it to your car knowing the number you put on your app when ordering.  

Why not develop that same system with Subway instead of putting the model and color of your car and saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Here.‚Äù Because in reality, by putting the curbside number on the app, they ( Subway employee ) know you are here waiting anyways.  Nobody cares about the make, model,  and color of the car when ordering food. It‚Äôs all about getting the order to the right person in a timely manner. Also their are so many different shades of each color of each car out there. So I would suggest using the Curbside number system which will make things much easier and smoother for all ( for the patron and the employee )."
"I‚Äôm floored this app has such a high rating.  I find it very cumbersome to use.  Today when double checking to make sure I chose the ‚Äútoasted‚Äù option it takes you through customizing and then the ‚Äúadd to bag‚Äù comes up again.  So I needlessly doubled my order and received 4 foot-longs instead of 2.  None of those darn things are toasted either.

Secondly, the stores I frequent are poorly run.  I‚Äôve had numerous occasions where they‚Äôre out of guacamole and then look at me like I‚Äôm from outer space if I ask if they reimbursed me for the extra charge.  Today I got to the car and realized they sent me without any napkins.  They didn‚Äôt see my special request to put the meatballs on the side of the meatball sub because- kids- and there‚Äôs no option to just custom order a sub with pizza sauce, pepperoni and olives.

It‚Äôs all so frustrating I had given it up completely then came back thinking it would speed up our road trip.  Now I have a mess of 2 extra sandwiches, no napkins, loose meatballs and a crabby family all around.  Not to mention I bought more sandwiches than I care to transport or eat.  I won‚Äôt be back."
Ok I have to give them credit for replacing my order although i wish they‚Äôd dress my sandwiches like they did the second time cause that was perfectly correct it reminded me oh how subway first ever had me hooked the taste of all the explosions of the veggies and sauces was spot on I like banana peppers lettuce tomatoes olives mayo and honey mustard in every bite and their willingness to go beyond and make it right I am glad about as well the app was ok as well I liked how you can customize it how you want it althgh for future reference please consider 2x as a good amount then you‚Äôll never go wrong  cause commonly extra or double 2x amount doesn‚Äôt seem to be double but normal amount . But I am happy but i hope I don‚Äôt have to give a bad review or complain to get an order correct in future . Thanks for making it right guys .i was very satisfied with my 2nd replacement order.
"The Subway app has updated and changed for the worse. First is that the app makes it ridiculously difficult to select or change the store your ordering from. Sometimes even refusing to do so after you select the store you want, and given the no refund policy it can hurt having the sandwich  you payed for in the wrong place. Second the app constantly runs into errors having once completely ignore my order, after I had ordered it and everything. 
Lastly the app charged me TWICE for one sandwich. The app order history says one sandwich, when I picked it up I had one sandwich, but my transaction history on my bank account has two separate identical charges for the sandwich. I am currently trying to see if this can be resolved but be warned.
With the above said there are more rough unintuitive parts of the app like accessing your cart or editing it bar those problems don‚Äôt bring actual consequences like misplaced, unplaced, or double charge orders like the other problems.
Before the update the app didn‚Äôt have these frustrating problems but now I just say, call the store ahead instead and save yourself the trouble."
"Worst food app ever I think. It keeps clearing the cart. You have maybe 3 minutes to complete the order or you have to start over. If you manage to get an order placed you then find That it was a waste of time because regardless of what is entered into the app you will be picking up what the sandwich maker wishes to prepare rather than what you ordered and then you will be told that is your fault. You have to step them through making the sandwich. They have an aversion to not toasting a sub. I ordered 4 subs, none toasted as that is an option in the app. 3 of the 4 sandwiches were toasted and the one that was not was in the same bag steaming and getting soggy. They actually told me they always toast the subs and threw their hands up when I insisted that I ordered exactly what i wanted - app has choice of toasted or not, and I ordered not toasted, but that seems wrong to them. Lol. Meat on about half the footlong had to be spread out. Just awful. You have to actually direct every step or they will just throw it together with whatever toppings they choose. Or better yet save time and go somewhere else."
"EDIT:  the app does now allow me to order a sandwich.  So that‚Äôs an improvement.  Everything else below is still bad though.  Added one star back. 

Favorites are impossible to manage and weirdly include the restaurant so you need multiple favorites for the same sandwich if you live and work  in two different places or if you are traveling, you can‚Äôt use your favorites.  Selection of location is cryptic and often results in being stuck unable to add food to purchase.  Can‚Äôt change restaurant after picking food.  Why can‚Äôt I choose to use my points as a payment method?!   This update has actually made it impossible to order anything.  Error every single time I have tried the last couple days.  So many opportunities to do better it‚Äôs impossible to list them all.  Whoever you all got to rewrite this a few months ago should be fired and possibly subjected to the game of thrones walk of shame.  Worst implementation of a simple storefront I can imagine.  Seriously, I just want to order a sammich and have it ready when I arrive.  The app used to do that amazingly well."
"This app went from buggy to completely non-functional. Open the app and after a few taps it crashes and closes. I‚Äôm not going to spend any time detailing the exact issues I‚Äôm experiencing because the Subway response will be the same copy and paste response they have given to everyone... ‚ÄúWe want to help, please contact us at.... yada, yada, yada...‚Äù. Bottom line is, the app doesn‚Äôt work for most people and needs a drastic overhaul by competent developers. So far all that Subway has had to offer is copy and paste lip service. Make a meaningful effort to your customers and admit that the app is broken and that you‚Äôre actually addressing the problem with qualified developers (assuming that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre actually doing). There are more complicated apps out there that perform flawlessly, so yours doesn‚Äôt have to be an exception - hire qualified people Subway."
"For some unknown reason this thing changed my order time to 3:35 PM when I‚Äôm trying to order lunch at 11:30 AM. Then it charged me. I had no idea it had set it for four hours later, until I went back to see when my order was going to be ready. If you go to try to cancel the order in the app it just gives you a number to call the restaurant location. The restaurant location told me they couldn‚Äôt even see the order until it was 15 minutes before the time. So there is no way to cancel this order, unless I sit and wait around to cancel it at approximately 3:20 PM. Well, I have a job to do, and I don‚Äôt have time to be thinking about canceling this order in their magic window. 

I‚Äôll just go to Hardee‚Äôs. You‚Äôve got $8.55 out of me, Subway, and I‚Äôm deleting your app. And I won‚Äôt go stand in line, so I guess I‚Äôm done with SUBWAY¬Æ. If I can order through the app four hours ahead of time I should be able to cancel the order in the app four hours ahead of time, or at least cancel it through the restaurant without having to be scheduling a call in a magic window."
"There is a limit of six for each order, so I had to have two orders. This app is not updated with locations that have advertised deals so calling each location before you order. Plus the new sandwiches are not updated which means maybe you won‚Äôt want BBQ on a BBQ sandwich. Due to training every location makes condiment sandwiches even if you request ‚Äúlittle‚Äù or ‚Äúlight‚Äù sauces. On my second order I received two of the of one sandwiches and clearly made the order not this way. Disappointed after getting home then traveling back to the location to get my money back for just the wrong sandwich I was told NO. They could not refund just one sandwich and told me I possibly could go through something online. There is nothing on the app for this option. The only refund is for the whole order, at location, and then repurchase the sandwiches that were made correct. Thanks for the lesson in total $60 for two orders and not what I ordered. I won‚Äôt use app or order at locations again."
"Today I spent $24 dollars for an $8 order. I use food apps all the time and this app is by far the worst at picking up my location...I only order in two locations and every single time it picks the wrong location...other apps see where I am and what locations I most commonly use and when I place the order it‚Äôs always in the right location...today I had an order go to an Anaheim location, and San Pedro location (West St). The problem is I wanted the order to go to the San Pedro location on Western (which is the only San Pedro location I ever visit). I have never visited the one on West. I even tried to cancel the order and the person on the phone said they didn‚Äôt know how this could be done and unfortunately they could refund me...long story short two locations today got $8 from me and I am not picking up the food. Spent $24 today and I only wanted to spend $8. This app by far has the worst location intuition of any food app I have ever used. Thanks Subway for the fun day! My recommendation for anyone using this app is to diligently check the location even if you go to the same location every single time!"
The woman at the subway I go to is horrid. I thought it was only me until a guy came to pick up an order and told her have a nice day and she ignored him. Then she treated my husband the same way. Everytime I go in I wait 20 mins for her to acknowledge me or if she does she will say ‚Äúhold on I‚Äôm doing online orders‚Äù she was nice my 2nd time ever going in because I left her a 15$ tip my first time even tho she was terrible thinking maybe she is having a hard day maybe she had a death in the family. So the next time she was polite to me but that was the day she didn‚Äôt even acknowledge the other customer or tell him to have a nice day. That woman should not have a job in customer service but that is neither here nor there thank you to whoever made this app and saved me from spending another min with this wretched woman!!
"I agree with gentlemen‚Äôs comment from two years ago.  The app may work sometimes all the way through the order and customizing your sandwich.  When it came time to pay, I found my current default payment information had expired.  There is no way to edit your default payment with new expiration date and cvv so I was forced to re-enter all my payment information again and save as default payment.  After hitting ‚Äúplace my order‚Äù again I received a strange error message ‚ÄúUh-Oh, error on property ‚Äòupdate‚Äô and on undefined.‚Äù  Have no idea what this meant as I tried to enter the payment information four times with same error after hitting place my order.  After four attempts I had to use the old fashion way of calling it in giving my order over the phone.  Apps are supposed to make it easier and more efficient not cause you to waste your time.  There is no way to contact developers thru the app except coming back to App Store to leave a review as your website wastes your time again giving no way to submit issues.  Pretty sad!"
"Our order was not processed on time. The app said it was ready for pickup. The app was wrong. The store had not even begun to process or make the order when we arrived. 

We had to leave because we could not wait any longer. The employee was fixing customers sandwiches who had just walked in the store instead of fixing our online order that had been placed over 20 minutes before. 

For a refund, we were told by the employee that they could not refund our money and that we had to call customer service. But the employee did not have the customer service number. 

There is also no way to request a refund on the app or anything to troubleshoot should an order go unfulfilled. 

When we finally found a number using Google (because the Subway website does not list a number), we got an automated message saying that app order issues can only be handled by sending a message through the website. Which is ridiculous. 

Perhaps a troubleshooting tab on the app. Or a way to request a refund through the app. Anything but having to go to your website and click through to find the right form. 

We did submit an inquiry on the website. Five days later, no response. And certainly no refund. 

An overall horrible experience. We just wanted food on time. Or perhaps an easy way to get our money back when the store failed to get the order ready on time. The app, the website, and any resemblance of customer service from Subway all failed."
"I‚Äôve previously tried to have my barcode scanned in the store to earn points only to be told either the scanner doesn‚Äôt want to scan it, doesn‚Äôt work, or some other reason. Today was the first day I made an order on the app and went to pick it up. Not only was my husband‚Äôs order wrong but the female employee was not even trying to see my phone to verify that my order did indeed include a 3rd FREE footlong sub. I mean...absolutely REFUSED to look and even MAKE the sub! It was paid for ahead and everything. The other employee there did look at my phone and verified that there was in fact a 3rd sandwich in my order but ended up having to pay for it out of pocket himself?!?! He shouldn‚Äôt have had to have done that for my order to be made as the promotion was for Buy 2 footlongs and get 1 footlong free. The woman who refused to look at my phone then said that I shouldn‚Äôt place the order online anymore and just show them the offer in the store. I don‚Äôt know what the heck is going on but this app is more of a hassle than anything for the few times I‚Äôve actually tried to use it."
"This review involves the remote ordering and delivery on the app. The process is very poorly designed. I expected that the app would be like ordering at a Subway shop but it is not. You cannot order things on the app like you can in a store - they restrict the available vegetable toppings and actually don‚Äôt allow you to add certain topping that you can normally just choose and point too. Secondly it‚Äôs a very limited choice of condiments. No Chipotle or Sriracha. No Ranch?!? Seriously. Items normally available at the store (like the toppings and chips that I know were at that Subway) were not available. Also at payment time it crashed and told me my payment didn‚Äôt go through, and I would have to clear the cart and start over, but it still charged my card. And the order did go through. But if I had redone it as the app said, I would have had 2 meals...Very disappointed in the app and it‚Äôs lack of selection to be able to create the sandwich I want. That‚Äôs exactly why I appreciate Subway. Don‚Äôt like the app at all."
"Although the experience of pushing a few buttons and in a matter of minutes enjoying a good sandwich is incredible, I must review this app relative to other companies achieving the same functionality. This app is clunky and full of disruptive popup ads. It frequently gives errors and long load times. The favorites function is unusable. Also, don‚Äôt add a gift card to your payments because if it isn‚Äôt enough to cover the tab it doesn‚Äôt allow you to use an additional payment option to finish the order. So, if your gift card is worth $10 but your order is $11, you can‚Äôt use your gift card at all. A waste. Also, you don‚Äôt get notified about any progress of your order through the app. You‚Äôll get an email when your order has started to be made. Emails aren‚Äôt instant so it‚Äôs often that you‚Äôll never know when your order is ready. Hope this helps both Subway developers and customers."
"Update: I tried to edit this right away when I realized it was a user error (aka my fault!) but apparently the edit didn‚Äôt save since I just received a response. The type if sandwich I was selecting was on...a ciabatta bun? Or something and apparently only came in the 6 inch option. It was not an issue with the app! Sorry! 

So I went to order subway which I‚Äôve done several times without issue. This time it made me update before ordering. My son wants a 6 inch sub‚Äîit took me a minute to figure out where the 6 inch option was as I had to remove my sandwich and start over (it wouldn‚Äôt let me edit the size after I started customization). Anyway so I got it in the bag but then when I went to make my sandwich, the foot long option was completely gone. I tried a few different things, closed the app and restarted it and still, it won‚Äôt let me make a footling sandwich. I am pregnant and hungry and aughhhh! Haha please fix."
When i tried to make an account and half of the keyboard was cut off and it was also at the top of my screen. Went to safari to make an account because i thought ‚Äúsmall bug for creating accounts‚Äù but no it‚Äôs the same for signing in. I‚Äôm deleting the app and seeing if anything changes in a month. I also really only got the app so i can count my calories because the website on safari wouldn't let me build a sandwich due to it being midnight and they‚Äôre closed. But i thought to myself that the app will probably let you order ahead and it doesn't. It also doesn't let you order as a guest. 1/5 stars because you tried and i‚Äôm sure its hard to keep up an app but you're a big company you should do better for customers and your employees. I say employees as well because i read a review that its been hard for stores to get orders from online/from the app. Maybe take those options away for a while and figure out how to make it better for your employees? Apps are very convenient but not when they aren't working.
"I downloaded the app because the regular online ordering failed miserably. And it was even worse. It took me 10 minutes to find the fine print to add/customize normal toppings. Next, the site kept telling me my local store was closed, when a phone call verified it was very much open. Next, after that ordeal,  despite trying three(!!) methods of payment, every one failed, returned a random error and then I‚Äôd get logged out, forcing me to log back in and do it all over again. Same problems each time. Lastly, all the hmHelp or Contact Us links threw up a 404 Not Found error.  Wonderful. 

So I download the app. At least this one shows my local store as open, but while attempting to build a sandwich, I notice that if you try to add multiple toppings from a category (i.e. cheese), it removes the one you‚Äôve already selected.  So if you want cheddar and swiss on that sub, you‚Äôre apparently out of luck. I gave up after this. So who knows whether the app would have had the same payment glitch. I won‚Äôt be finding out anytime soon. Tonight just became pizza night. 

It‚Äôs 2019, guys. Fix your tech."
"So I ordered my sub off of the app to be delivered, when I clicked finish and pay the sun hadn‚Äôt saved what I wanted done to the sun so it just added all the sides of lettuce, spinach, tomatoes, etc, it wasn‚Äôt the same bread I picked, it wasn‚Äôt toasted or had the cheese or bacon I added. I called the store and they said there was nothing they could do because that‚Äôs what came over on the app. Then my food was delivered without a drink. The store wouldn‚Äôt come back and deliver my drink OR give me a refund, the only way I could get a refund was if I went to the store and by that point I may as well pick the drink up myself. I asked if they could give me a refund for the major inconvenience of having to pick up my order when actually I got it delivered and they said there wasn‚Äôt anything they could do other than give me a coupon‚Ä¶ which was expired. I‚Äôm extremely disappointed with the app. It‚Äôs supposed to make everything easier when it really just messed my order up for the same price. If I get subway again I‚Äôm just going to go into the store."
"I used to live in California, and in California there is a special Subway app specifically for that state, which I hadn‚Äôt understood at the time since I first started using Subway apps when I moved there. Having moved to NC, I noticed there is no longer a delivery option. Why does subway not deliver outside of California? Or if it does, why not in any location anywhere near the southeast US? I‚Äôm not talking about catering, I don‚Äôt need to order dozens of subs for some event. I just want to order a few subs for lunch and get them delivered to me while I continue working the whole time. Is there a reason why only California seems to deliver for individual orders?
Also, on both apps you cannot make any special requests except through notes. Yet 80% of the time the workers do not see the notes. So I have no way to order multiple cheeses with the app, I can‚Äôt ask for a little extra toasting (since the breakfast sandwiches are always, at every location, still cold with normal toasting).

 The app is very limited in general with little real customization through the customization option."
"During the pandemic I get several ads for this ‚ÄúFamily Takeout Deal‚Äù for the buy one, get one free footlong and you‚Äôd think every store would offer this right now. Actually finding a Subway that offers this is so impossible that it‚Äôs ridiculous and I live in a major city. I even called the location closest to me and asked if they did the family take out deal and the employee just says ‚Äúuhhh what is that..?‚Äù  REALLY? Their employees don‚Äôt even know what‚Äôs being advertised. They just pick and choose which locations will actually give you a discount and you have to take the time just to track it down if it even does exist. Because the ‚Äúdeals‚Äù section in the app is completely blank, I have to go through to choose a location, pick 2 subs, and wait until the end to see the cart only to find out that that location doesn‚Äôt do the discount.... I use to work for Subway before this app and things were a lot easier then. You‚Äôre driving business away when you advertise a BOGO and then your company‚Äôs employees know nothing about it"
"I got this app because I go to subway about 2-3 times a week, and I saw the BOGO coupon today and clicked on it, the coupon said ‚ÄúBOGO discount automatically applies in cart‚Äù so I was like okay awesome, so I clicked on it and it was not clear with directions on how to use it, plus I went to order my subs, and it NEVER applied the coupon, and I asked about the coupon in the store that I went to pick my subs up from, and they said ‚Äúyou already paid for it and we can‚Äôt give you a refund because your money didn‚Äôt come to us, it goes straight to headquarters‚Äù So now, I will not ever spend my money at subway until they get this issue fixed, and I spend a ton of money at subway, so beware of this if you use this app, because it is a total scam, and plus at multiple locations, I have had the workers skip out on some of the ingredients meaning that I told them a lot of pickles and they gave me 6 for a foot long, and I asked them for a lot of olives, and they gave me 6 of them (FOR A FOOTLONG), I have complained multiple times, but nothing has changed."
Normally this app works great. However yesterday I tried to use it. I ordered my food and pressed place order. It got stuck there. The money was pending out of my account but I never got an order confirmation and when I went to the store that was supposed to have my order they said they never got the order and there was nothing they could do. So I went and took out the cash from my account because they guaranteed me that the money would not actually go through. So I paid in cash and this morning my account is now negative with a $25 over draft fee and soon to be more overdraft fees because I have other things coming out of my account. There is no number or email or anything to contact someone to get my money back even though the people at the subway store I ordered from said there was. All they can say is they have nothing to do with the app and I can contact someone on the app. But I can‚Äôt and now this little mistake is gonna cost me $100 in overdraft fees. That‚Äôs RIDICULOUS. Thank for stealing my money and costing me more!
"I have used the app multiple times to order pickup, but my last experience made me remove it from my phone completely.  I ordered and went to pick up my food, but the location had ran out of most of their food so they could only fill part of my order.  Then they could not refund me and said I had to dispute the order via the app.  The Subway app doesn‚Äôt offer dispute options.  It took multiple messages to their customer care, who didn‚Äôt get back to me until two days later, to get a refund.  After their social media customer care told me it was the location that had to refund me.  The manager at that location told me the app doesn‚Äôt link to the locations at all.  It‚Äôs worth the extra few minutes to order at the location, cause now I‚Äôm waiting for a refund that won‚Äôt come in for at least a week.  Don‚Äôt use the app!  If anything is messed up on the order or at the location, you‚Äôll be waiting days and going through Subway‚Äôs hoops of digital customer service."
"I‚Äôve had nothing but problems from the local subways, usually long (we‚Äôre taking an hour plus) waits because they refuse to hire enough people.  I thought I could give the app a try.  So I put together an order for the sub meals, being given several errors along the way slowing me down. I press the checkout button after spending about 15 minutes putting the order together, and then it comes up with ‚Äú we‚Äôre sorry, this location can‚Äôt take your online order right more‚Äù. Frustrated already, let‚Äôs try the other subway in town. I put that order together only to find out they aren‚Äôt honoring the current deal and it would cost almost $20 more for my order. Of course complaining to the store does no good. Last time subway forwarded my complaint to the store owner, who simply said to send him anyone I knew who might be wanting a job(this was after an hour long wait for a phone order placed hours prior).  I give up, deleted the app. Forget subway and their horrible service, there are better options."
"I use your app several times a week. I see several issues:
1) if I leave the app open after a purchase scan it consumes 80% of my iPhone 6s battery, this has happened several times so I have to quit the app after ordering.

2) the scanning at purchase for payment and reward points is unreliable.  The interface given the cashier to use a linked credit card must be clumsy because I often have to rescan multiple times. This may be a training issue, a human interface design issue and/or a technical problem. I can‚Äôt tell from my side of the counter. But it is a problem.

3) the thin ribbon entitled ‚Äúshow card‚Äù is above the screen horizon and harder to find than necessary.  The button/ribbon should be visible all the time and taller to make it easier to find and then select. The scrolling adverts are of no consequence to me. I always order the same sandwich in person.  The subway joke of the day is a waste of space. I just want a simple screen to pay and get points. Put all the clutter elsewhere.

4) what‚Äôs with the free cookie reward? I apply the reward but the clerk either does not see the reward or ignores it. I shouldn‚Äôt be eating cookies anyway but why offer in the app if there is no intention to serve it?

Fix these issues and my rating changes to 5."
"I placed a Order Online. Picked up order & got home & realized the Manager made our Subs wrong. I called & she talked to me as if I was a dog. She was yelling & over talking me. Stated she was remaking sandwich nor refunding even tho my order was wrong. The Manager was extremely racist, rude, unprofessional, unsanitary & the most rude person I seen in my life. She told me to leave before she call the police & told us to get up out the chairs and stand up. The police came & tried to talk to her about refunding me since the food was incorrect & I no longer wanted the sandwiches. She said NO. She was touching surfaces & picking up things off the floor not washing her hands then she kept touching everybody food as if she was trying to get customers sick. The Manager was completely violating COVID19 regulations. The food was never ate & I‚Äôm stuck without a refund. I will NEVER IN MY LIFE visit subway again with RUDE RACIST UNPROFESSIONAL Managers like her. SHE NEEDS TO BE FIRED. The location on the Subway is 4405 Elvis Presley Blvd in Memphis, Tennessee.

This happened April 28, 2020 around 1:17pm"
"UPDATE: since the last update, the app only allows you to pick a sandwich and add to cart.  There is no longer a way to select 6‚Äù vs. footlong or to add/remove ingredients!  Had to call my local shop to submit a pick up order!  Please fix this.  That is a major error‚Ä¶

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

The way this app walks you through ordering is very intuitive and actually fun. Pay through the app. Then, just walk in the store and pick up. Easy and quick. And if you do the traditional in-store order, having both rewards card and payment method in the app puts everything in one easy place. But if you want to pay cash or a method not in your account, you can do that, too. The only thing I don‚Äôt like is it only gives four protein options for the kids meal. If you want to get one that‚Äôs not built in, like tuna, it won‚Äôt let you customize the protein, and you‚Äôll still have to order in store. Could use a tad more flexibility in that respect. Still, great app!"
"So far I‚Äôve had a superb experience while using this app! I‚Äôve only had it for a week and have placed a order from it on two separate occasions within that time. It‚Äôs a great app, but it could still use some improving. 1) While ordering cookies, there should be a way where you can choose more than one type of cookie at a time. Also on the ‚Äúmy order screen‚Äù afterwards, the list of cookies you chose should be listed to confirm it was picked correctly should be shown instead of just ‚Äúcookies‚Äù 2) I tried to order and customize a personal pizza and realized there‚Äôs no option to add ANY type of vegetables! It also only gives you three meat options, so I had to login and use the web version to complete that half of my order instead 3) there also should be a way to incorporate coupons before you pay. 

I hope to see these issues implemented in the future upcoming updates"
"I love when food places have an app that you can order and customize your food ahead of time and just walk in to pick it up. I‚Äôve used the subway app many times and found somethings that I don‚Äôt understand...

1st is why all locations don‚Äôt have the same options on their app as every location has the same ingredients. For example, when I go inside, I order turkey & ham sandwich, but very few locations offer a turkey AND ham sandwich on the app when it‚Äôs doable in the store.

2nd and most frustrating is that every time I order a sandwich, something is wrong. Forgotten lettuce, forgot the cheese, forgot to toast it, forgot bacon, forgot ham, wrong bread (one shop did call me to tell me they were out of the bread I choose, which I liked), forgot the sauces, etc. I think by now I‚Äôve experienced each ingredient missing at least once (minus bread - that‚Äôs a little hard to forget). It‚Äôs not just one location either so I assume something with how the order is sent to the sandwich makers that it may need to be formatted differently so they can see it better.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love subway and their app has AMAZING deals. I just wish that either the sandwiches would be made accurately or there‚Äôs a way to give feedback on each order that can be sent to the shop so they can improve or simply use in-app deals when ordering in person."
Worked great the first couple times then I had an issue where it defaulted to a previous pickup time hours later than I wanted it. The people in the store said there was a 1800 number on the app because it isn‚Äôt actually subway‚Äôs app it is ran by a 3rd party so after scouring the app I see it says call the store to cancel. Seeing as how I had already tried this I decided to just go to the store where they advise me to just not pick up my order later and the order and pay then and there and that worked. NOW a couple days ago I get an email saying thanks for updating your app your order will be ready soon. SOMEONE HACKED MY ACCOUNT changed my name to their name and paid for their order in Chicago with my credit card. I live in Indiana. I call the number the email provided for if I didn‚Äôt make that order only for it to tell me they went all digital and to send an email complaint. Bottom line the app is INSECURE AND TO GET HELP ON OR WITH! Just order in store save yourself the headache. Shame on you subway for launching such a spotty app!
"Some apps you try to order through just are not user friendly. You try to edit the order to your liking and it doesn‚Äôt allow it, or the app says you have coupons you can add, but when you try to it doesn‚Äôt apply to the order. I‚Äôve never had any of those problems with the subway app! I love using it. I order my sub, select the time I want to get it, I go right to the location of my choose, and it‚Äôs there, exactly how I ordered it and for the price I asked for. I honestly have not found an issue yet with it. I have had the occasional occurrence where I go to order something, and the screen does not load, but that‚Äôs simply due to spotty service! If I ever find something I don‚Äôt love, I definitely will edit my review to include it! But so far, everything is good!"
"I use this app constantly. If you like subway, then you NEED this app. It keeps track of your orders, lets you create a sub and then save it as a ‚Äòfavorite‚Äô, so next time you just click on the ‚Äòfavorites‚Äô button and choose it. You also earn coins. Collect enough (easy to do) and you can get $2 off your next purchase (or save them up until you have $4, or more). Different deals going on through the app, too, such as free cookies, drinks, or chips, or even great deals like 2 foot long subs for $5 each. The app will also email you other promotions going on. Finally (the best thing) is that you do not have to stand in line. Place your order through the app, wait 10 minutes or so, then simply walk in and get your sub. If you are not using this app, you are missing out!"
"This app never works. I can‚Äôt pay with it, and I put funds of 50$ on previous version that had been working great. After I put funds sometimes at the beginning of 2017, somebody at Subway decided that they need to change the working app, with this one that don‚Äôt. After that for almost 3-4 months, my funds were stuck with no option in the app, to pay with it. After that this app came along and I tried to pay at least 30 time with it, and I did only few times. Sometimes the app is not working, sometimes the employees doesn‚Äôt know what to press to charge me. So today was the best: On international Sandwich Day you can‚Äôt use the app, because there is ad over the app when you open it, and it doesn‚Äôt go away no matter what you do. I still have some 4-5$ stacked in this app, and I wanted to use it, but I can‚Äôt. So Subway, would you do something about it? You are losing business because of this app. Happy International Sandwich Day to all Sandwich lovers out there"
"Subway is the closest place to my office, so I go there all the time. The app usually is very convenient, but lately I‚Äôve had an experience that is just frustrating and it‚Äôs been going on for about a month now. For starters, I am unable to apply the $2 off any of my orders. Errors have been occurring every time I‚Äôve tried to use it.

The errors have come up EVERY TIME I use the app now. It takes 2 or 3 tries for me to get a confirmation of an order. 
However I just found out a few days ago that even though the error occurs, the order still gets sent to the restaurant without me knowing, and I get double or triple charged for my orders, and I still only get the one confirmation. Y‚Äôall need to really try to work on the commutation between the guest and the restaurant and the app, because it‚Äôs ridiculous to get errors every time I try to put a order in and then get charged for a sandwich order I didn‚Äôt even know went through."
"I have used the Subway app 2 times and both have been HORRIBLE! First use I made an order from the app and went to pick my order up and the location advised, they were closed and no longer making orders. Which I had to wait 2 days and go back there to be refunded. The second time has turned me off completely! I placed an order, only to arrive to the location and it was closed! Also, was told by the station it was attached too that it has been closed for 2 days with no word on reopening. I tried calling the 800 number and was told everything is now by email, so I sent in a message advising of the situation and that now I was out of money for subs that I could not get and would like a refund. I received a message back advising ‚Äú Thank you for your feedback, our apologies on not updating our app, I have forwarded your reply to our management team. However, no info on my refund or anything!  I would have given no stars if I could. I will never use this app to order food again!!"
"I love the Subway app and use it often. I visit many locations and have found the app to be very useful. I mostly visit two different Subways near me, but especially the one closest to home. The Subway location on the app close to my home does not reflect certain information correctly. They offer breakfast all day, which is something I order often, but the app says they do not. Therefore, I‚Äôm unable to order breakfast at any point of the day on the app. They also have pepper relish at this location, but it‚Äôs not a selection on the app. I have reached out to Corporate about updating the selection criteria for this particular location a while back, and haven‚Äôt seen any changes. I hope one day they make these changes so I can properly use the app for my favorite Subway location."
"I will neverrrrrr order from a mobile app again . I trusted subways app because I had been using it for the longest, and I can link my PayPal account to it.... however, SUBWAY in Fayette, MS on the other hand, has workers there who are not concerned about helping customers. I made a mistake and ordered two of the same wraps on the mobile app. I called in to the store to cancel one and the girls giggled and said No they couldn‚Äôt do anything. I then called customer service, they said they couldn‚Äôt do anything either all they could do is reach out to the franchise owner. How do you not have an OPTION TO CANCEL an order you just submitted not even minutes ago!!! No one wants to cancel my order and refund me my money.  I never want to go into this store again. Hours later the girls call my phone laughing and saying these exact words ‚Äúyou need to come pick up your order‚Äù I said ‚ÄúI told you hours ago I did not want the order‚Äù she says ‚Äúso, you already paid for it come and get it‚Äù and hung the phone up in my face!"
The app used to be intuitive. Now it‚Äôs cumbersome and won‚Äôt let you choose options. Favorites are no longer easy to use either. So I have to rely on going to my history. Problem is they don‚Äôt give you any information on the summary screen about the details of the orders are so you constantly have to close and open each one to see if that‚Äôs the one that you would like to re-order. It also will not let you use your rewards and less you start from scratch on the order. So it takes away the convenience. And when I tried to place my order from scratch for a breakfast sandwich it will not let me choose a white eggs or mozzarella cheese I am stuck with the standard items and then I have to make all kinds of notes in the comments so they will even know what to make. It went from a nice app to a nightmare. I also find that text I get on deals I cannot use through the app so I have no way of applying the deal to my order.  I am treated better as a customer that signed up for text than a repeat customer.
"The subway I typically go to is good and has good staff, however it doesn‚Äôt seem like subway pays attention to who the delivery drivers they hire are. When my order arrived, half of one of the footlongs was missing and the remaining 6 inch had been crudely rewrapped. I‚Äôve never had an issue with the store and it genuinely appears that the delivery driver just chose to take half of a foot long and attempted to badly rewrap the rest. When I called the store, they said there was nothing they could do other than remake the order and have me go to the store to pick it up since they can‚Äôt put in complains about the delivery drivers either or do anything else about it. If delivery is going to continue to be an option through the app, there also needs to be a way to rate and place complaints about the delivery drivers. I will no longer be using the app for deliveries and will instead use Ubereats or any other delivery service when I find myself wanting to order subway again."
"I love the app. unlike other reviewers, the swiping left on items to customize or remove is a breeze.  My only criticism is the dressings selection.  If you order a salad. there is no where to add a salad dressing, such as fat free Italian. I am only left with the comments area to ask for a Italian dressing.  And most of the time the people at the subway location don't even read them.  I always get asked at the window or register, ‚ÄúDid you want any dressing?  I tell them,‚ÄùI wrote it in the comment area!‚Äù Their response,‚Äù Oh we never see or read that area.‚Äù.   OH BOY... sad.

I think all dressings should be listed for selection. Yea you get the normal selections mayo, mustard, red wine vinegar..etc... but not any of the other choices. I hope the developer reads this comment / review.  And seriously takes this request enhancement under consideration. 

Otherwise great app.  No waiting, just stop pickup and go!"
"Look, I understand that you want customers on the latest version of your app, but this isn‚Äôt a banking or financial services app, and even many of those allow you to use the app, even when an update is available. 

Not that it isn‚Äôt already extremely frustrating to be forced to update when all you wanted to do was scan for points or scan to pay, but to make matters worse, every time you force an update you also log us out. 

most of us not are app experts, but all of us have enough apps to have an opinion regarding the difference between good app practices, critical app practices and annoying app practices. Subway continues to fall into the latter - you are not a banking app and if you have to force updates to patch critical errors (at every update) then perhaps you need new developers who don‚Äôt leave our data at risk every time a new version becomes available. And if that‚Äôs not what‚Äôs happening, then STOP WITH THE FORCED UPDATES & ACCOUNT LOGOUTS FOR A FRICKIN SANDWICH!"
"I‚Äôve used this app for several dozen orders in the last couple of years. Overall it works, but I‚Äôve had numerous problems including:

1) orders are rarely ready by the time estimated. Usually it‚Äôs another 5 to 10 minutes or more. Staff do not appear concerned about this. Of course they can be busy, but what good is a time statement if it‚Äôs consistently missed?

2) app does not refund missing items. I added avocado today, but the store was out. The store and app have no way to remove that charge. They offered to give me cookies or a bottle of water, but I didn‚Äôt want any of those. 

3) ingredients are often omitted. We ordered a tuna sandwich a few months back. Picked it up, drove to a picnic spot, and discovered the sandwich had no tuna. Today a BMT was missing the pepperoni. No indication the staff realized the omission. There‚Äôs no way to report problems or request a refund. 

4) favorites are often useless. If you try to order a favorite, but that store doesn‚Äôt have a particular ingredient in the favorite, it won‚Äôt let you add it. It won‚Äôt tell you what is unavailable. Only choices are ‚ÄúFind another location‚Äù and ‚ÄúContinue‚Äù‚Äîwhich skips adding the sandwich and returns you to the main menu. It should show you what is unavailable, and then let you add the sandwich anyway and customize as normal."
"An order was placed at the wrong location (I thought it used the location a) I have selected at ""my location"" and b) the closest to me and NOPE it chose a location 20 miles away. I tried to cancel and all it did was tell me to call the store. She told me she canceled and for whatever reason, I was still charged. So now I've paid for two Subway lunches on the same day/time but only got it once. Now I have to go fight for my money back instead of this app having a more secured way of canceling the payment and not having to trust the store employees will do it correctly. UPDATE: I was able to send feedback through the overall Subway website and was corresponded with immediately and in just under a week (still a little longer than I think it should've taken) I did receive my money back. I had to go pick up cash though (he was able to refund my card for some reason)."
"Downloaded the app, created my profile, tried to add a payment method... no dice. So maybe it will let me after I create an order? Put two customized sandwiches in there, added a couple of cookies, tried to add a payment method... nope. Maybe it doesn‚Äôt like Discover? I‚Äôll try adding a MasterCard instead. Hmm... still nope. Well, maybe I have to place the order first? Nope. Can‚Äôt do that either. I have an iPhone 8+ and a reasonably new version of the iOS (11.3). You folks just updated the app about a week or so ago. This is disappointing. üôÅ

UPDATE: so I saw someone mention updating something on the website... and so I logged in there and - lo and behold! - it let me add my Discover card there. When I came back to the app, I fiddled around for a second and it let me order with my Discover card. But you folks aren‚Äôt off the hook! I should have been able to do all this on the app. So please fix that? Thanks!"
"So I‚Äôve used this app many times actually. I love this app it was super easy to use but now since the developers tweaked it it won‚Äôt let me on anymore. When I pull up the main screen and enter my info it said forgot your password let‚Äôs get you a new one so I changed it but every time I put in my info, I hit accept new terms it just takes me back to the forgot your password screen. 

       The app is not realizing that I have accepted the new terms and letting me into the actual app, I am not a reviewer by any means but I feel if something‚Äôs added or been taken away it‚Äôs my job to let you know how things are running and it‚Äôs not smoothly. I gave this app five stars because in the beginning the app worked great but now I can‚Äôt even use it, it‚Äôs only using up storage on my phone."
"The app is buggy - kept making me delete everything and start again if I wanted to change one thing. It kept changing the bread I wanted. Subway REALLY wants me to have 9 grain bread. It made me do 2 orders instead of allowing me to just order 2 sandwiches. We couldn‚Äôt cancel our order when the sandwiches weren‚Äôt made.

The big problem is that the employees of our Subway weren‚Äôt able to figure out what the app said. My husband ran in, they hadn‚Äôt even started, and were standing there totally baffled by our basic sandwich orders. He told them we didn‚Äôt have time to wait, and to cancel our order. It‚Äôs been nearly a week, and the charges are still on our account. We paid nearly $20, in advance, for sandwiches we never got. The bank is going to fight the charge. 

I love the idea of ordering ahead, and picking it up in a flash. That would be great, even if I do have to erase and redo the order a couple of times. But the employees have to understand how the app works, and there has to be a way to cancel a sale."
For the creators ‚Ä¶  so I actually do like app testing and give feedback as a like side gig and when I use a new app I can‚Äôt help but to offer my opinion ‚Ä¶ when I was placing my order I had multiple similar items 3 subs and many cookies ‚Ä¶ well everytime i would finish one sub sandwich I was asked if I was ready to check out or continue shopping ‚Ä¶ Then when I hit continue shopping it redirected me all the way back into the main menu to navigate my way back to the subs all over again ‚Ä¶ which was irritating and I feel unnecessary. If the customer is adding their last item you may be better off to add in some add on items ‚Ä¶ preferably your higher selling ones per the general district area ‚Ä¶ it asked me if I was ready to check out so many times I got irritated and just checked out instead of getting the other chips and cookies I had wanted ‚Ä¶
"Been using this app for a few months now with no issues. But recently was visiting a family in Ohio and tried to use the app to make a purchase which has been a nightmare. The app has incorrect hours of operation! They charged me for 2 sandwiches and told me they would be ready at 9:30 pm. Show up to the subway store to be greeted by what looked like an employee who hated her job. She told me to come back tmrw for my subs! Fast food should be exactly that I have no interest in driving out to a location to claim subs I needed that evening. They have yet to give me a refund, how an app can simply charge you and have no way of processing a refund is mind blowing. Very disappointed in subway.

FYI did contact customer service and was told the store would need 48hrs to refund and not worry. That time has come and gone with no refund. I love how all the responses are subway cares and to call them to make it right. Don‚Äôt bother unless you want to wait for 30 minute to talk to someone who can‚Äôt do a thing. App is simply a way for stores to steal money."
"Gave it 2 stars because I used to use it all the time to grab a quick lunch while at work.  It was easy to order and even easier to pick up when it was done.  For the past couple months it‚Äôs been nothing more than a location finder.  It errors out when trying to order and when looking for the rewards you‚Äôve earned.  It is nothing more than a battery/space hog on my phone due to it being absolutely useless.  **Note to the developer, please do not respond to this review with one of your canned responses.    You‚Äôre better off not saying a word than opening up your mouth and confirming to everyone that you really don‚Äôt care.  Everyone of your responses are the exact same every time.  Subway has literally lost my weekly business due to your incompetence and crappy customer service skills.  Oh and by the way, your latest update (yesterday) fixed absolutely nothing.  Bravo."
"This app is no longer user friendly, WHATSOEVER. I have tried being patient but everytime I try to find a way to contact support I just keep getting sent in a never ending loop. The subway mobile app website that says if you are having issues go under the ‚Äúcontact us‚Äù in their app... well that doesn‚Äôt exist. 

I just want help because my subway offers the flatbread option but for some reason on the app it isn‚Äôt showing up. I have tried deleting and re-downloding and it does nothing.  Another big user error is that if I want to get plain chicken strips I have to order the premade bacon chicken sandwich and I can‚Äôt eat bacon, and there is no option to remove bacon.

It‚Äôs a sub shop, there should just be a build your own sub option.  I really don‚Äôt leave bad reviews but I really like subway and this app has been great until recent changes and I can‚Äôt get anyone to help me. PLEASE SEND HELP, leaving this review is the only way I can think of to get someone to reach out."
"If the restaurant isn‚Äôt open, you can‚Äôt even browse a menu, much less pre-assemble your sandwich in advance. One should be able to pick the sandwich and ingredients they want whenever they want, then submit the order at the appropriate time, or even save it to the Favorites. 

Similarly, you have to submit your order no more than one hour (+/-) in advance of the pickup time. A much smaller (and less affluential) regional chain has managed to make it possible to submit an order not only several hours in advance, but a WEEK in advance. 

One should be able to submit a lunch order before going to work in the morning, so one could just leave for lunch at the appropriate time without having had to use work time to choose and submit an order, or try to do it while rushing to the restaurant during a limited lunch break."
"Update: Since I originally posted this review, they have updated the app and fixed the problems I previously complained about.  As a result, I am revising this upward. 

Original: I really love the convenience of being able to order my food ahead of time and pick it up without having to wait in line. Unfortunately, they keep ‚Äúimproving‚Äù the app and breaking things.  I dread seeing an update to this app because I never know if anything will work right. Today, I opened the app to order and I couldn‚Äôt find my favorites, it kept fighting me on changing restaurants and it kept telling me it‚Äôs pickup time for an order I picked up two days ago. 

I finally managed to get the restaurant changed ‚Äî or so I thought because the screen had the restaurant I wanted ‚Äî and started an order from a previous order. I favorited the sandwich, but favorites still don‚Äôt appear anywhere.  To add insult to injury, I opened the email confirming the order and guess where it sent my order ‚Äî to the subway it didn‚Äôt want to let me change away from in the first place. 

This seems to happen whenever there is a major update. Functionality either disappears, fights you, does the wrong thing or just doesn‚Äôt work at all. It‚Äôs really frustrating and I‚Äôm sick of it."
"The app functions well but really caters only to customers that want to order specific menu options. There should be a ‚Äúcustomized sandwich‚Äù or ‚Äúcreate your own‚Äù option to allow customers to order exactly what they want. All menu sandwich items have locked items that the customer cannot remove. My specific location doesn‚Äôt honor promotions or member points unless you order through the app because they don‚Äôt have a scanner on site. Some locations may have different ingredients from other locations and if that‚Äôs the case then the app should pull based on the location. I realize that requires more work but it provides full service to customers which should be the priority. In the end, I can‚Äôt even use the app or benefit from promotions or member points due to not being able to fully customize my order."
"this app is fine, it does the job mostly. i however have had experiences where it absolutely went non-functional and i‚Äôd get stuck on loading screens and/or have to redo my order. quick customization and pickup is nice‚Äîbut delivery feels like a scam. they make a big deal about ‚Äúfree‚Äù delivery and other discounts but the majority of discounts you apply will be negated by the small order fee. i understand and celebrate the need for adequate pay for delivery drivers, but giving me a $3 off coupon and adding most of it back kinda defeats the whole purpose of having a discount to begin with. this issue won‚Äôt effect larger orders, but for someone like me who‚Äôs just ordering a meal for one (which i imagine is the VAST majority of users) it‚Äôs pointless. just save us the trouble and don‚Äôt hang discounts in front of our faces if they don‚Äôt mean anything :/"
"I placed an order for delivery through the Subway app.   Apparently then, a DoorDash delivery driver came into the store to pick up my order, but Subway had never received it, so I never got my delivery, and got a notification that my order had been cancelled.   I called the store directly, who then took my order over the phone and I had to go get my food as a pickup.  The employees told me that they never have had any delivery drivers and were very confused as to why there was a delivery option on the app when they have no delivery at all.   They were also concerned that the order was never submitted to them from the delivery app.  

So, because this was inconvenient for both me and the employees, I‚Äôm rating it a 1, and will be deleting this useless app.  

When I use an app, I expect it to work, and I expect it to communicate to the restaurant it says it does.   This does neither.  The employees were great, and made up for the poor quality of this app."
The app is good but needs improvement. It needs improvement in my opinion around the store location button . And I guess she read my GPS and see where I at I was sickness I want Subway. Like I should read my GPS and see where I‚Äôm at I was sitting there so I want to Subway and ordered from another subway seven minutes away previouslyAnd it sent my order back to where I had previously ordered which was a hassle but I needed to double check that IAdmit that but it would‚Äôve been a lot easier if it double checked and verified where I wanted to place my order. Also canceling ordersShould be a really a one button push instead of a phone call and there should be a feature where you double check if you‚Äôre sure you want to place the order instead of one touch press your order is going to be ready etc.
"My kids eat Subway about once a week so when I saw there was an app I was thrilled. Downloaded and it was buggy at first but it seems they just had a few launch hiccups. So if you had problems before.. circle back and try it again. The main issues I have with the app is the fact that I can‚Äôt ‚Äúpre-build‚Äù a favorite (or at least it isn‚Äôt obvious where I can build my custom sandwich and favorite it without submitting an order). I tried to pre-build and save as a favorite so that the next time i headed there.. I could submit my kids order, walk in and pickup .. but no. That isn‚Äôt an option. One has to submit an order first and THEN you can favorite it. The second issue I have is no Apple Pay. Come on guys.... it isn‚Äôt that hard to add in!"
This is the 2nd time that the app has submitted and order before I was ready. The first time wasn‚Äôt a big deal because there weren‚Äôt any coupons but today you had the promo for the buy one get one for $1. Right after I hit the second sandwich the app closed and when I reopened it the order was submitted before I was able to add on my other two footlongs. Called the store and they couldn‚Äôt understand why I was upset and told me just to add on the other sandwiches with another app order with the coupon but the coupon is gone. They kept telling me it would work but it wasn‚Äôt showing up on my end and I wasn‚Äôt going to place an order and be charged something different. This is my only frustration with the app I love the deals I don‚Äôt know why this has happened twice now. And I usually only treat my kids to subway if we have app deals so if this can‚Äôt be resolved well unfortunately have to be done with subway.
"I loved this app. It was so convenient to be able to pick up a quick lunch, and with 1 click be able to order, and pay my last specific order ‚Äú4 people‚Äù without any hassle. However today I hit ‚Äúrepeat last order‚Äù on the app Only to walk in and have some kid yell ‚Äúcash only man!‚Äù I said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs cool I have already paid, with Apple Pay on the app I can show you the proof from my bank‚Äù. He said ‚Äúoh I have to call my district manager and see what you ordered?‚Äù After 26 minutes of waiting for this dude to call back I said ‚Äúthis is not worth getting fired over‚Äù (lunch break)! And went back to work. I could call my bank and say ‚ÄúI paid for nothing‚Äù who would believe that? I could call subway and received nothing and be in the same boat. So I‚Äôm out $25. There is no safe guards on this app. You probably could order, and after hours only to show up to a closed building. This app is awesome just call first to verify they are functional."
"UPDATE: Subway fixed the issue and I was actually able to place an order from the app. Thank you, Subway!! Updated my rating from 1 star to 4. 

The only reason for 4 stars and not 5 is because the user experience could be better. While the new experience looks cool, I like the old user experience better because all options were right on the same screen. For example, I wanted cheese on my sandwich and had to go hunting around until I found on a separate page I could add it. It‚Äôd be nice to have all options available on the same page. But it‚Äôs usable and I‚Äôm just glad I can order from the app again! 

ORIGINAL REVIEW: App just sits at loading screen. Been doing this for several months. Still doing it after most recent update. This happened on my iPhone 6 and is still doing it on my iPhone XS Max."
"The app gives a lot of headaches. Tried submitting payment method, kept on giving error messages. This is after having closed the app and reopened it a few times, when that didn‚Äôt work I switched off the phone and restarted it a few times, still didn‚Äôt work. I eventually gave up, reopened the app a few days later, and find my payment information had been added. But what good is that? It wasn‚Äôt available when I was hungry. Next, when I tried placing an order, it asks you enter your location so it can find the closest subway to you. It couldn‚Äôt even find that, it kept giving an error message. I repeated the whole cycle of closing and opening the app and rebooting the phone. Still no success. It‚Äôs Subways‚Äôs loss really, they lose a customer, but I can use another app for another restaurant and place the order. Anyway, no need to reply, as I‚Äôll be deleting the app after this review. This is just an FYI, to improve your app."
"The options to re-order from a past order and to create or use a favorite are either not working as intended or just not user-friendly. I tapped a  ‚Äúwant to re-order?‚Äù link, which showed me prior order from September...but there was no apparent way to actually use this to start an order. Maybe if I already had an order in process, there would be? But in my case I just wanted exactly what I got last time, so I hadn‚Äôt already started an order. I ended up just re-creating it from scratch.

Similarly, I saw that I had no favorites (thought a prior order might go here automatically, but I get why they're separate). It said you could create a favorite as you order. When I got to the end of ordering, I saw a little favorites heart icon...but that just took me to the ‚Äúyou have no favorites‚Äù page.

I know these are first-world problems...but the time-saving features ended up just taking extra time."
"App gets the job done to place order, but no recourse for mistakes in those orders.  Order placed isn‚Äôt what is printed on receipts, everything is jumbled or revisioned leading to frequent mistakes in fulfillment.  This is a hollow shell of a useful app.  It exists only to take your money and leave you in the wind when they inevitably mess up your order.

The only way to contact customer service to report a problem is through a form on the website where they request your personal information which they share with to the local store, and have the store call you to say they‚Äôll fix it on the next order - no options for a credit or refund.  They literally want you to follow up on their mistakes by spending more money with them.

If you‚Äôre going to order subway you are better off using a delivery service instead of this app - at least they listen and respond to bad service by giving you back what you are owed."
"It‚Äôs a great idea!  And I use similar apps with other fast food chains.  The app works great and I can detail exactly what I want.  NOW, it‚Äôs seems about 90% of the time (and I‚Äôve been using this for about 3 yearsish), the staff at these Subway chains seem to ALWAYS not read my orders correctly, especially when it comes to seasonings, ‚Äúextras‚Äù like extra lettuce, etc., and double meats.  It‚Äôs like every time I open my sandwich on the road......I‚Äôm like ‚Äúthat‚Äôs such a small looking sandwich!!‚Äù.  Every time when I‚Äôm actually inside Subway they get my orders right because I‚Äôm there to watch them.  I think most of these workers like the app so they don‚Äôt have to use up all the food and make them smaller in size OR they just don‚Äôt like reading the details.  It‚Äôs been happening at TONS of these chains.   Enough is Enough, I will stop using this app and will just stick to going inside from here on.  I love Subway but I sure do not like the execution of the orders from the app."
"I have always loved Subway sandwiches and felt like they are a healthy fast food choice but the drive thru line is always long because the sandwiches are not pressed.

I have not felt comfortable using the kiosk the chains have turned to since the Covid virus since I don‚Äôt want to touch a screen everyone else had touch do we have quit going to Subway for this reason until I found this app. 

No more waiting in the long line in the drive through. I just order my sandwiches in the app. By the time I drive to the Subway store the sandwiches are waiting for me on a designated shelf in the store. All paid for so I don‚Äôt have to wait in any line in the store. I just walk in and out! It is great!"
"UPDATE: Please allow the gluten free bread option when building a sandwich using the app! This app is now useless to us since we have 1 GF family member and the app doesn't list GF bread as a choice, even though our Subway offers it in the restaurant. Additionally, the updated version is nowhere near as easy to use as the original version. It crashes and is slow overall. 

Original: I love this Subway option! We used to avoid Subway with 3 kids because the lines are always long. Not anymore! This app lets us build our sandwiches quickly and easily and even pay ahead of time. We just show up, skip the massive line, and get handed our order. The fact that the options are limited for sides on the app is alleviated by the fact that they let you grab them at our Subway so I can still get the chips we want even though they don't show up on the app. This is a game-changer for us when we occasionally need to eat out and find a fast food option. Genius!"
"Have been using the app for a while now. In my opinion, the app is not worth the time. Very slow and too many steps involved to make an order. Most of the time you can just go to the store and order faster than using the app. Takes several minutes to go through all the steps to make an order then if you don‚Äôt remember to put your order in in advance the app turns into a 30 minute process over all. There are also frequent updates which tells you the app developer is figuring things out on the fly and constantly having to correct things. Constantly have new bugs with mine after every update like not attaching my name to the order and listing it as unknown confusing the restaurants I‚Äôm ordering at. Subway is convenient because of so many locations but I enjoy using the Lenny‚Äôs app when a restaurant is in the area I‚Äôm in, much better. It is so simple, they just don‚Äôt have as many locations."
"So-I‚Äôm normally the nicest person ever. I was nice til he said it wasn‚Äôt his problem. 

I ordered via the app-2 pizza subs. Removed all the items pretty much except the pepperoni. Went and picked up. Got home. Order was wrong. I called and the guy said come back up. So I drove back with both sandwiches. He told me to pull to the window, since this particular establishment has a drive thru. I told him it has sauce on it, but I didn‚Äôt want sauce. I ordered it without sauce-specifically removed the sauce-even shows it on my app. He then told me-not his problem-not his fault. The pizza sub comes with marinara sauce. I said yes I get that-but I said on the app I didn‚Äôt want sauce. He then puts the receipt in my face and tells me ‚Äúit says in special instructions-don‚Äôt cut with a knife and don‚Äôt touch sandwich with knife-doesn‚Äôt say you don‚Äôt want sauce. Not my fault‚Äù. Then tells me he won‚Äôt remake the sandwiches. Um-what?!

I then have to open the app and show him I removed the sauce-he told me it comes with sauce. We went back and forth repeatedly. Then finally he says next time put it on the special instructions you don‚Äôt want the sauce. 

But why?!

Why do I have to when your app lets me remove it?!

Then should I just put on special instructions-I want nothing on this except what I‚Äôm saying I want on it and please don‚Äôt touch or cut with a knife? That seems like a waste since I already said I didn‚Äôt want the sauce üôÑ"
"Version 7 has one improvement and many problems.  Naming a favorite order and keeping it at the ready was an excellent idea.  But the mapping to find a restaurant is terrible.  Yesterday I couldn‚Äôt get it to let go of one restaurant so that I could find a closer one.   Today it's claiming that the there are NO restaurants in several locations where I know they exist.  And using pictures without words for designing a sandwich seems like a good mulitcultural idea, but it is more difficult for me.  

And why can't I add spinach? My customer is my sandwich I want to add spinach

This is now six months after I wrote the above. I haven‚Äôt proved the app quite a bit. Now the only thing that is needed is to allow you to save a favorite sandwich.   currently the favorites are all associated with specific restaurants. I wander all over the place, and only want a favorite sandwich, not a favorite restaurant."
"This app is really great overall. I love the user interface - extremely user friendly, clever, and unique. My only complaint is about the ""Deals"" feature. When you pick a deal, then pick a location, it should immediately tell the user if that location does not accept the deal. Instead, it allows the user to go through the entire ordering process before telling them at the end that the location chosen does not accept the deal. This would be tenable if it didn't force you to start the entire order completely over! If this one thing could be fixed, this app would be flawless. It really is a cool, well-built app overall. But that feature is a legit ""I'll never use this stupid app again"" thought inspiring annoyance. üò¨"
"I love ordering online on Subway because I get deals that way; however, the app usually goes slow, my order doesn‚Äôt always go through and I‚Äôve had problems getting my favorites to go through easily. This last time it worked really well but I kept getting an error message and the cart didn‚Äôt show that it went through but I ended up having the item in there. Since I didn‚Äôt know it went through I ordered it again and ended up having 2 orders of the same sub. Once I figured out the error message wasn‚Äôt really an error I just ok‚Äôd through them and arrowed back each time I wanted to go back to the main menu with the favorites bar again. Using the icons for ‚Äúadd another‚Äù didn‚Äôt work."
Ordering is very easy through the app and I love that they offer deals and rewards. My biggest beef is that you can‚Äôt order more than an hour ahead of time. I have a very limited lunch time and I would like to order in the mornings and schedule my pick up time but it will not let you. Furthermore if you tried to order from a store that is not open yet do you have to wait until they open as it will not let you select that store. I would simply like to select my sub and store for a schedule the time every day like I do on so many other apps. They need to fix this so that you can schedule a pick up time more than one hour in advance. Highly frustrating trying to order and pick up all in 30 minutes
"I get an unspecified error when trying to sign up, on both the app and the website. I‚Äôve tried different email addresses, I‚Äôve tried removing the (-) from my phone number, I've followed the password requirements to a T. The error says to call their number and then press #2. I do this, only to be greeted by a very happy robot lady telling me that I‚Äôm being better served by robots than humans, which might be true, except this robot is clearly a sadist. I press #2, as the app says, then the cheery psycho robot lady says ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a problem sending the text‚Äù and tells me to go back online.

I have no way of contacting an actual human. How do I sign up? How do I load a gift card? I know you guys are in the middle of a big rebranding, but this is silly. I just want food. Send me to some outsourced phone rep on the other side of the planet, I don‚Äôt care. Give me food. Give me human contact. Give me Steph Curry if you want. I just want to load a gift card. My gosh."
So I have Apple Pay PayPal and credit card so this app is supposed to take any one of these.....wrong! I take the lengthy time to order so I can get the 5 dollar foot longs and get to the end and it states this store does not except payment on file so I‚Äôll try another and again and again. Get frustrated and go to the store itself and of course their not allowed to give the discount. How convenient subway! That‚Äôs how you screw people! I liked the app because I didn‚Äôt have to stand in a store in line with 10 other people during our 6-feet apart mask wearing stage. The store stated they to had complained (whether this is true or not) I feel you should be ashamed to be taking more money from people in this time of crises by not fixing your app! If your not going to fix it then allow the discount in store!
"I wrote a really bad review of this app a while ago, because it was hands down the worst take-out app as far as design, but it has been improving and is now ‚Äúokay‚Äù. The food is always correct and ready on-time. The app requires frequent updates and won‚Äôt let you order without the update, meaning if you‚Äôre in a hurry you have to wait. The UI is better than it was, and not quite as cluttered, but it is very, very buggy. Sometimes you can‚Äôt order at all because it glitches out. It‚Äôs not always the same glitch, either, it messed up at different steps. Out of the past dozen times I have used the app, three times I couldn‚Äôt complete the order and had to go in person and order at the counter, and once I just ordered from somewhere else."
"I have a family of four, one being autistic, so our orders get king and complicated. I tried to order a sandwich with just salami and bologna but I couldn‚Äôt because there‚Äôs NO option to create a sandwich from SCRATCH. It MAKES you pick a premade sandwich and customize it‚Äîthis wouldn‚Äôt be a bad thing if it didn‚Äôt disable you from changing the meats, so you HAVE to pick whatever meat combo they have preset. What‚Äôs the point of that? Subway is for allowing anything to be CUSTOMIZABLE, so why can‚Äôt I just have an option to create a sandwich from scratch? Next, the app doesn‚Äôt show all the toppings, drink, and chip options. I tried to get oregano but it‚Äôs not even an option. I tried to get Salt and Vinegar Lays chips‚Äîthey didn‚Äôt have the option. I know the location has it so why not the app? App is the most frustrating app I‚Äôve ever had the displeasure of ordering from."
"Edit:  They updated the app and broke it for my iPhone 10xr.  It allows you to build a sandwich and then errs out when placing in the bag after trying for a minute.  Very irritating.  Forces me to lose out on deals or choose somewhere else to eat. 

Old:  The app itself worked well.  After order I noticed there might be options for contact free delivery after order was placed, but maybe it was just ‚Äúcoming soon‚Äù.    I will look more closely next time before placing order.  

My ‚Äúin store‚Äù experience was not very good.  I walked in and saw a bag with my three pre-paid sandwiches behind the counter.  All the employees had to do was verify my name and hand me the bag.  Instead a I had to wait in line for three people to slowly go through the normal sandwich creation process.  

SUGGESTION:
Train employees to be aware that the new customer that walked in might be the one who has that completed order waiting.  Take 10 seconds to verify the name and hand them their pre-paid order rather than making them wait 5+ minutes while others complete their orders normally.

UPDATE:  It‚Äôs all good. I read the app instructions more closely.  Just walk to the register directly.  This signals the employees you have a prepaid order. 

 I also noticed a contactless delivery parking.  Just  pull in and call the number in the sign."
"Over all, it does work. Layout is fine, nothing to write home about. 
BUT‚Ä¶.
Every launch of the app starts with an error. Not a comforting sign, but I have been using it and it works, so I think it is just something they over looked. 
My big issue is with the mapping. They show you pins on the map, but when it comes to finding a convenient location, you better be familiar with the address system in your town (or leave the app and Google, but I ahiuldnt have to do that). Every other food app shows the pins on a map. You click on them and that stores info comes up and ready to order. The map and the address list are in no way connected. 
I ended up driving across town and back again to find which store had received my order. Very frustrated."
"So apparently, I went to this app, hoping it can be a service to me for ""ordering on the go"". Looks like this app doesn't do so well when trying to ""ADD A NEW PAYMENT METHOD!"" Yes, seriously, adding a new payment method. It seems that the most buggy and most messy mistake of this app would be adding a new payment method. How is it that this app can give me an error whenever I try to add a new payment method?! I DON'T KNOW! What I do know is that subway will fail at their job of ""not"" fixing this problem, if they don't tackle this issue soon. Please! I BEG YOU! Fix the issue where I receive an error for adding a new payment method! It doesn't have to be this way! You can change my life for the better if you fix this issue quickly. I don't know how much longer I can wait before I order on the go on Subway again. I think I'll die without Subway's working order app (joke implied). Anyway, please fix this issue soon and PLEASE reply back ASAP and let me know if it is fixed. THANKS!"
"This app is horrible. I hate using it. The navigation is awkward. There is a menu on the left but multiple ways to access things (ie payment method and gift cards) all of which are a dead end and then you have to go back to home page again to do anything. In addition, I linked my gift card in the app. Since it was downloaded to the app, I threw away the physical card. I mean, that is the point of the app right? Unfortunately I have gone to 3 separate Subways and tried to use the app to pay for my meal and they are not able to use the gift card within the app. So now I have to use a credit card even though I have $25 on my inaccessible gift card which is infuriating. I ask the employees in the store why it does work and they say they do not know or the computer just says invalid payment. I then show them my app and where it says I have money left on my gift card and they still say the system is not accepting it for some reason."
"My problem is where are all the options? Where‚Äôs the option for milk in the ‚ÄúMake it a Meal?‚Äù screen. Also I just picked up my order and had to tolerate a Diet Coke because there‚Äôs no Mello Yello selection option in the app ANYWHERE that I can see. Yet I know for a fact it‚Äôs one of their drink options if you go into the stores. Same with chocolate milk. Also, seems there could be a ‚ÄúNotes‚Äù or ‚ÄúSpecial Instructions‚Äù option on each item so if you have kids that are splitting a tuna sandwich and one wants olives on their half and the other wants pickles in their half one could send that request through. Currently I don‚Äôt see ANY of these seemingly no-brainer ideas as part of this app. Now I titled this review the way I did because I think for the most part it‚Äôs a nice app and it‚Äôs convenient. It just seems very inadequate when it comes to having all their options available."
"So using the app was great but the end result did not match what I ordered. I ordered 4 Sandwiches Even though I put different toppings on the sandwiches they came out with three of them all the same and the last one was missing several items off the sandwich. They did call me to let me know that they didn‚Äôt have the bread I wanted they literally only had two types of bread out of all of the lines they offer. I have tried to call the store six times with no answer it just keeps hanging up and telling me to go back because the sandwich maker is busy. This is why I do not suggest this app at least when you order in the store you know you‚Äôre going to get what you asked for. The app is useless when no one follows what you asked for. By the way I did ask the lady when I picked up the sandwiches the types of sandwiches and she said I don‚Äôt know I didn‚Äôt make them.
HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE at the Santee town center location!"
"It‚Äôs crazy how when you order a sandwich online and it has everything included like lettuce,tomato etc. Everything else except the CHEESE(which is usually included free) which if you forget to add you have to tell the person to remake it or go home with no cheese on your sandwiches. I ordered online picked it up and went home. 

So I called the guy who made the sandwich and he forgot to add other toppings like olives and onions. So I basically had this weightless sandwich.  Basically he said he couldn‚Äôt do anything about it. I told him every time I use the app something messes up and I admitted it was my fault I forgot the cheese. But I said everyone would get cheese on there sandwich it‚Äôs like ordering a pizza with no cheese. He said sorry that he couldn‚Äôt offer me anything or a refund and he told me to complain about the app."
"When I first got the app I was actually happy that I could order my food and pick it up when I arrived to my location but then later I started to have issues with the app then later realized that I couldn‚Äôt make my sandwich the way I wanted to make it unless I actually went to my location and did it in person, so I started to not like the app within time, now I just use the app when I go in person and just scan the barcode when I order my food at the location, not really as convenient as I thought in the end.

üëéüèº would really love the app more if they gave me a better variety on the app and let me do more choices to my sandwich ü•™ instead of having to go to my location and make it there instead, would make the app a lot more better if they updated it. Then I would give this app 5 stars instead of 2."
"Your app is defective. Why is it that on the other food delivery apps CUSTOMERS choose whether they would like their sandwich toasted or not but on the actual SUBWAY app SUBWAY has made the decision to TOAST all sandwiches by default unless the customer specifically chooses not toasted? Why is TOASTED chosen for us and the app allows the customer to submit the order without choosing for themselves? I feel that the app needs an update that UNCHECKS TOASTED and allows the customer themselves to choose how they would like their sandwich prepared. 

Another company would have compensated me for my negative experience while Subway just says, ‚ÄúThank you for your feedback.‚Äù Yeah, I think that was my last Subway experience."
"The problem is that it not only re-orders the sandwich and sides, but the app also chooses the same store location even though a customer just selected a different store. 

Generally I like this app. I was frustrated when today I placed an order from it. I found a store that was near me and convenient for pick up and ‚Äòselected‚Äô that store. Then I went to the handy recent orders tab. There it lists what I have ordered in the past. It also shows the date, time and location of those purchases. I selected a sandwich from that list and chose to re-order it. I was disappointed to find out that I needed to drive another 30 miles to claim my now 45 minute old, not so fresh sandwich."
"Downloaded because I forgot my wallet at home. Just like any other food app, I could order and pay with my card info without the need of my physical card. However, I didn‚Äôt like how there wasn‚Äôt a create your own sub option. I was restricted to select from the existing menu options, and I couldn‚Äôt even remove certain meats from those. Since I was already present in the store I just instructed them on how I wanted it, despite how the app forced me to order it. Would definitely be better if I had the freedom to create my own sub, or AT LEAST remove core meats from an existing sub.

Specifically I just wanted a 6-in ital. herb & cheese w/ pepperoni and shred. mozz. (literally that‚Äôs all), but was forced to order a spicy ital., remove everything, and request no salami personally."
Customer service was excellent but my major problem is the Subway app. Why is there only one person working at any location at a time? What is the purpose of ordering through the app when I have to wait 45 minutes for my order. That is not just this location. It has happened at other subway locations too. I order through the app for many restaurants but SUBWAY takes the win in the slowest service through the app. Cannot blame employees because there‚Äôs only one at a time. How can they take care of customers waiting + the ones who ordered on the app. I gave Subway three chances at three different locations via app. The app is the most useless creation and a waste of time for the developers who created it. It serves zero purpose. Service is slower thru the app compared to me going regular to order.
"Placed my order. Waited until the due time. Went in. Waited. Asked if they received my order. They did. I waited and waited. Watched customers come in get in line and get service without placing order ahead. They got their food and left more came in and got served.  I was in the store. Tried standing in line. Apparently the giant online order ahead of mine made me invisible even tho regular customers were being served. Horrible experience all around. Actually self boycotting subway completely because of it. At least after digging for an e-mail we received our money back, since you know, I waited 30 minutes and never got my order even started. 
I‚Äôve been using the subway app for a couple months now. It‚Äôs generally ok. But this experience trumps any of that. It was rude and unprofessional to say the least. Zero stars."
"The app is great, love the functionality of the app, but the ordering process needs some work. First, I tried to make the order as a guest, but was forced into signing in. Second, when it came time to pay, it took 3 times of attempting my order before it went through with Apple Pay. Third, the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here‚Äù button doesn‚Äôt seem to work. After clicking the button, confirming I‚Äôm here the screen flashes. After 5 times of doing this, the app is stuck in a loading state. I waited 20 minutes for someone to bring my food before finally walking into the store. I give 3 stars as I‚Äôm a developer myself and the amount of work that went into making an app like this doesn‚Äôt go unnoticed. That being said, I wouldn‚Äôt release an app like this without the flaws worked out."
I used to LOVE this app because I could order ahead of time and pay from the app. It saved me time on my lunch break because all I had to do was pick up my order. Now the stupid app isn‚Äôt taking my payment information. I have gone through the trouble of choosing my order and getting to the check out only to find that the order won‚Äôt go through because there‚Äôs no card on file. I‚Äôve tried several times to update the info but all I get is an error. I have lost my rewards because of this. And I can‚Äôt take advantage of the app only deals or online order deals either. I tried to contact customer service but everything is done online and there isn‚Äôt an option for app support. I‚Äôm so frustrated about this. I used to love Subway and the app but I have not ordered from them in almost a year.
"Multiple different times I have tried to place a mobile order and it will say something went wrong at checkout. I go to my bank account to find that it charged my account multiple times. (I will however say that they stayed as pending and have gone away. I‚Äôm bothered by the inconvenience of it) The time between the first time this happened, to the last time I tried using the app was a couple of months. I was sure whatever was wrong was fixed at least a few updates ago. But no. Same issue. Staff is always rude when I call about questions (which I understand isn‚Äôt the apps fault, however I wouldn‚Äôt have to call and stress myself with having to do so, if the app just worked in the first place) and I just feel like it‚Äôs not worth keeping the app and trying anymore. I use to use it often because it‚Äôs such an amazing app without these issues."
"I‚Äôve had this app for a little over a year and it has been great to be able to order ahead and dodge lines when I‚Äôm on a tight lunch schedule. It‚Äôs easy to customize your meals and then simply go inside to the pick up area for your order. Sometimes they have decent deals If you order through the app (sometimes they aren‚Äôt so great). One thing that I disliked was not having coupon codes, but they have that feature now which is great! I did have an issue since the most recent update with the app not locating any locations near me but only my own location. But I deleted the app and redownloaded it and haven‚Äôt had any more problems!"
"I love having the app. We try not to eat out too often. When we do, we like subway more than most, and it is super convenient to order ahead of time. Unfortunately we are unable to select the drink we want from the app. At least I have not been able to from my IPhone. Also I frequently have trouble getting our local store on the phone to try and communicate any kinda choice or question I might have. So that could be another way to utilize the app. If there were a customer satisfaction survey with each transaction it would be a paperless and secure way of providing feedback on the quality of service provided at each location. Also, I‚Äôm not exactly sure how to use our circular coupons with the app. That is probably something I have overlooked though."
"Tried to order on website and it kept saying fraudulent card after dozens of attempts and double checks to make sure every number was correct. Assumed it was an attempt to get me on the app. Got the app and instead of it saying ‚Äúfraudulent error‚Äù it just wouldn‚Äôt add the card as a payment method. I tried that dozens of times only to complete the whole form for the card, hit done, and have nothing added to payment methods. It simply wouldn‚Äôt save the info. Updated new phone so that isn‚Äôt the issue.  Ultimately sent someone to the store for me and the order was 3 identical sandwiches. One was on the wrong bread all together and each either had an extra topping that wasn‚Äôt ordered or was missing one that was. Terrible experience overall. Subway purely based on the menu should be amazing but the app, website, and workers are subpar to say the least."
"Received email deal for $5 foot-longs if ordered 2 online.  
Went to Subway app, where I have acct and was going to choose our favorites, but guess what...no favorites listed.

Started new order, went through menu and ordered from scratch.  Went checkout and received error that items in cart did not match user.  Went to my acct info, looked good.  Couldn‚Äôt figure it out.  Then thought maybe deal expired, but it hadn‚Äôt.  

So then figured maybe have to order thru email.  So back email, app same and again no favorites to choose from.  Fooled around a minute and located my favorites at a store I had used previously, but not one I currently wanted to use.  Bummer.

Again started new order and previewed written summary of each sandwich.  Looked good.  
Went checkout and would not take credit card info.  Put in new credit card. Wanted scan new card, but that was not working.
Had keep going in and out of app and for some unknown reason it finally worked.  30 min later I had a confirmation.  Whew!  

Picked up food, got home and order was wrong.  Receipt showed items that I hadn‚Äôt chosen.  Again the written preview showed exactly what I had ordered before I checked out.  How did it get changed?   How does this happen?  I am now in the twilight zone.  What a mess, soooooooo frustrating!!!

All I wanted was a sandwich!"
"I have no problems with the app in general, but I mostly order the chicken bacon ranch. If I do so through the app, I always get a sandwich without any ranch and it‚Äôs not even something that comes up on the ‚Äúsauces‚Äù section or anywhere else in the app! If I‚Äôm not ordering for other people at work, I avoid the app, and when I am ordering food for myself and coworkers, I make sure to call the store I placed the order at and explain to the staff that eventually answers the phone (sometimes after several calls) that I want ranch on my sandwich. It‚Äôs hit and miss if I actually get ranch on my chicken bacon RANCH sandwich that I receive, even after I call and ask for it. 
I‚Äôll update my review when the main ingredient that I almost exclusively order is added.
I‚Äôve tried contacting through the subway app itself and haven‚Äôt gotten anything in return, so here I am, writing a ****** review hoping someone sees it."
"Comparatively to the many, many food apps we‚Äôre all using now (due to Covid), I  was shocked to see Subway has gotten so many ‚Äúgreat‚Äù reviews from ‚Äúnon-users‚Äù for a VERY poorly designed, inconvenient, inconsistent, cumbersome app!! I have my store picked and set, it still makes me confirm it when I place an order! I can‚Äôt add 2 DIFFERENT kinds of meat, or cheese to any custom sandwich! It refreshes itself every time I change ANYTHING!  Really?!! In this day and age of technology this app feels and works VERY antiquated!! And that‚Äôs saying something from a almost 60 year old!! ü§£  Subway, pleeeeeease hire someone from one of your competitors who have marvelously smooth, easy to use and understandable apps to completely redesign yours or maybe ask your REAL users or employees!  The employees don‚Äôt even use the app here in my town, otherwise they wouldn‚Äôt have told me to do something that I can‚Äôt even do on your app today!!! ü§™"
"First time using the app and it had tons of bugs. Timed out twice trying to log in. Every time I click the order button to pay I get a ‚Äúcannot read property ‚Äòupdate‚Äô of undefined‚Äù. Looks like a javascript error to me. Only way to place my order was to use Door dash app. I tried calling the store directly from the phone number on google maps, but got a modem line, so that was also needs to be fixed. Very surprised Subway doesn‚Äôt have automated integration testing to catch show stopping bugs like the ability to place an order. For any devs who might read this review, I‚Äôm unsure of the source of my corrupted state. It‚Äôs either that I applied the pop up coupon for the free foot long sub, or, when I first tried to buy my CC was expired, so I updated it, came back and was never able to order. I‚Äôm guessing one of those two flows causes that update property to be undefined."
"This app I think is pretty good compared to some other ones but it‚Äôs got the one worst thing of all, subway is supposed to be Myway and when you try to place an order and customize it with special instructions which the app asks for but then the app will not print it out at the store the special instructions for them to follow so how can I get it my way if it doesn‚Äôt print it for them how can you get it your way if it doesn‚Äôt print it the app makers need to pull their heads out!! Also the custom instructions only 140 characters long like a tweet and it‚Äôs only one what is your order three or four sandwiches everybody wants a little special instructions there should be a special instruction for each sandwich added that one at the final and stay away from this app if you want to make custom sandwiches!!!"
"The app used to work fine until recently. Are used to have to sign in maybe every month or so. This was probably for security reasons. I don‚Äôt know if there was an update or what, but it‚Äôs irritating that every time I login now I have to put in my password. Also there‚Äôs a little box that pops up that will ask you if you want to use your rewards. I don‚Äôt need a reminder so I always click the little box to not show it again. But when I login next time, there it is. Why asked me if I don‚Äôt want to see it again if you‚Äôre just gonna show it again. These are the only complaints I have. It‚Äôs really nice to get the rewards. I don‚Äôt really have any other issues with the app."
"This app has a very limited application. If you‚Äôre ordering multiples of standard sandwiches then it‚Äôs ok, but if you want customization, it‚Äôs quicker just to order from the drive thru. 

It won‚Äôt let you change the bread, it doesn‚Äôt include special instructions for each item only for the order as a whole. You can‚Äôt view menu items unless you enter the order process. Exiting a menu item in the order process is difficult and sometimes takes you out of app completely, so if you change your mind you sometimes have to start over. If the store is closed, you can‚Äôt enter the order process to even view the menu (no planning ahead). We spent over half an hour trying to order 5 subs and in the end, just decided to order in the drive thru. App is a waste of time."
"I did my first online order today and on the way to the store I get a call that they have no meatballs. I say ok just cancel the order and I‚Äôll go to a different store. They say we can‚Äôt do that, you have to do it in the app. App specifically states to contact the restaurant. I was already there so I went in and stood around for 10 minutes while they tried to figure out how to cancel the order and they never did figure out how. Turns out they did have meatballs they just forgot to thaw them so I had to wait another 15 minutes for the meatballs to thaw since I was already out my $18. Worst Subway experience I‚Äôve ever had and I‚Äôll never order online again. If they could have just canceled the order or even better transfer it to a store that knows what they‚Äôre doing with their inventory then it wouldn‚Äôt have been that big of a deal to just drive a couple miles to a different store."
"I ordered a salad today with avocado slices. Did I get that? Nope. Only realized it once I sat down to eat back at work. No way for me to get back that extra money I spent on this either. Thanks, Subway.

And how do you pick up your food? Well you can do curbside or in store.

If you do curbside during lunch hour, just know that you‚Äôll be waiting a while because Subway doesn‚Äôt have a lot of people on staff to actually carry out this implementation. You‚Äôll more than likely need to step out and go into the store. It‚Äôs not an inconvenience for me, but thankfully I‚Äôm not disabled or really in need of this.

The in store pickup is just as bad though. There is no formal way to do it. Customers standing in line won‚Äôt let you through because they feel like you‚Äôre cutting in line and the people behind the counter are busy taking care of customers in line. No formal line made to indicate where to pick up. No designated area set aside so customers can just come in and grab their food once it‚Äôs ready.

Awful and poor implementation. And this app has been out for a while and other restaurants that just started doing this are doing this a million times better.

Last time I‚Äôm using this app. Got screwed out of my money and what I wanted for lunch and felt awful when going in to pick it up."
"I ordered a sub buy one get one free. Unfortunately being new to this app I accidentally said done after the first sub. I went back and added the second-order but was charged for both however I only picked up two subs so I paid full price.  Understand each app is different but most apps you add to the cart then continue with the order processing adding additional items. If they do it differently they should put a warning "" are you sure you are finished adding items to your cart if so press continue if not press cancel and menu to add additional items. ALL SALES ARE FINAL "" this one little thing would get the app a 4-star review from me."
"I will NEVER AGAIN stand in line at a Subway store.  The App is VERY EASY to use from the first second you click the ‚Äòorder‚Äô button.  Regardless of how many customers are in line at the store ordering Subway has ALWAYS had mine done at the promised time.  You just walk up, tell them your name and then they hand you your bag and you leave since you already paid online.  I will NEVER AGAIN wait in line to order a sandwich from someone who mumbles, and has English for a second or third language (90% of them) and talks very low where I have to say (‚Äúexcuse me‚Äù) every single time they ask me a question about my sandwich!!!! I‚Äôve always loved Subway and because of this app, I can eat it more often now. LOVE, LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS APP!!!"
"Favorites can only be saved after an order has been submitted.  Favorites can‚Äôt be revised and saved, or deleted.  Sometimes certain details in the last order, or Favorite, change ‚Äîfor example, the type of bread defaults back to Italian when it was Italian herbs and cheese.  The order tickets in the restaurant do not print out fully detailed.  I have often had my order made incorrectly because I order a sandwich entitled ‚Äúegg and cheese sub‚Äù and I remove the cheese. The employees think there‚Äôs supposed to be cheese because it doesn‚Äôt read ‚Äúno cheese‚Äù on the ticket.  Or I had ‚ÄúGuacamole on the side‚Äù on my previous order, and I see it in the remarks on my repeat order but it doesn‚Äôt print out on the ticket in the restaurant so they put the guacamole on the sandwich.  There need to be some serious adjustments made to this app."
"I think the Subway app is really great for ordering. You get to pick your time to get your sandwiches and the menu is easy to use especially the way they show the layering of condiments-very cool. My issue is with finding the Cheese, Veggie, Sauces, Seasoning button. The little downward arrow is up in the right hand corner and you‚Äôre not sure to touch it or not-This should be larger. My other issue is the fact that Apple Cash crash landed on me to where it looked like I was going to cancel because it looks like the only way to pay. I almost cancelled. Finally when I looked again I saw the ADD PAYMENT METHOD. If these issues gets fixed then the app is Perfect! TY"
"Don‚Äôt order delivery on this. Ever. If there‚Äôs anything wrong with the delivery order, the place that made it won‚Äôt pick up the phone, and there‚Äôs no way to rectify it other than physically go to the store (which didn‚Äôt work anyway). Ordered 3 subs: a chicken teriyaki and two Philly cheesesteaks. Received a chicken teriyaki (minus the chicken) and a separate bread stick. The receipt showed what I ordered. Called multiple times - it went to a voicemail inbox. Tried calling Subway as there‚Äôs nothing in the app. They‚Äôve gone 100% digital (ie they ignore you). Filled out the survey about the form. Zero response. Went to the store with what I received and was told that wasn‚Äôt what they packaged up‚Ä¶ so was accused of lying.. Ended up charging it back though my credit card. So while this app is ok, customer service is nonexistent, and don‚Äôt get delivery as you can‚Äôt do anything about it if they mess up."
"So I‚Äôve had the Subway app for several years now with varying luck, usage and satisfaction.  Being able to pay with the app has always been a struggle for the employees and it has not been user friendly.  Recently it took a turn for the better, my app is carrying a balance, I have a ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù sub that I order, pay and pick up with a couple clicks!  I went to show my wife how the app has gotten better and it asked me to update the app before opening which I did.  Now.... I can‚Äôt even open the app!!!!!  I‚Äôve deleted it and reloaded, nothin and now my ‚Äúnew favorite app‚Äù is use less and I‚Äôm back to where I was two years ago!!!  Hey subway, I think it‚Äôs time to hire someone in IT that isn‚Äôt a relative!!"
"I like the app, but it seems to be very buggy at times. Twice the app has sent order with a credit card stored in the app without confirming the order. I move away to another screen in the app from order confirmation screen and get notify that an order has been sent without tapping confirm. I tried to cancel the order until a later time by calling the store, but order was already placed. The person I talked explained they had no control over the app. However, I discussed with the owner that it is part of their business model and should be more open to customer issues and resolve them with their corporate office. They did admit the was buggy. Could this issue be addressed in future updates. VERY FRUSTRATED!!!!!!!"
"Since this has been a problem three times, I‚Äôm finally going to write a review.  

Ordering from two different restaurants, the app has forgotten my bread and didn‚Äôt include it in the order.  The first time, they just made it with different bread that I don‚Äôt care for untoasted.  The second time, they just didn‚Äôt make the sandwich, and I was late because I had to wait in line and have them make it even though I ordered it twenty minutes ahead.  The third time, I even included bread notes in the special directions because I figured the app would mess up.  But they did what the first time did as well and I ate a sandwich that I didn‚Äôt care for and didn‚Äôt fit within my dietary guidelines because I already paid for it. 

The app outdoes itself.  I want to be able to order a sandwich and pick up the sandwich I actually order.  I don‚Äôt need cute diagrams of my sandwich, I need it to be accurate.  It was so much better when it was simpler."
"This app is great for customizing sandwiches however it doesn‚Äôt always work. Users MUST double check that the order has been sent & fully processed. I‚Äôm leaving this review now because a I have showed up to the store a handful of times only to find that the app had an error and my order was never sent to store. Additionally, today the app would not let submit my payment even though it was showing it had been applied, the submit icon would not highlight and allow me to click it. I restarted my order twice, backed out to the main screen, and re-entered my cart- troubleshooting. Eventually it ‚Äúworked‚Äù. I submitted my payment and everything seems good until I got to subway and learned they hadn‚Äôt  received any online orders."
"Placed my order and received the email confirming the order was placed.  Arrived at the scheduled time only to find out the Subway restaurant did not have my order.  I was told the order must have been placed at a different Subway restaurant.  I showed the information my order was placed for the correct Oakley restaurant.  The person then spent the next 10 mins talking to the restaurant manager.  I asked that they just make up the sandwich order, only to be told that they were still looking for the order.  I told them just forget the order altogether.  I get a phone call from the same Subway restaurant, telling me that they just received my order and I could come back and pick up my order. Let‚Äôs just say that didn‚Äôt happen.  I wouldn‚Äôt be using the App again as I spent more time just trying to get my order, then if I went in to order it in person."
"When I placed my order through the app I wasn‚Äôt able to pick a time closer to when I would actually be able to pick it up. When I arrived later than the pick up time the girl working came from the back of the store to complain that she had to make my subs during a lunch rush and then I was late picking them up. I only ordered 2 subs with barely anything on them. And correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but it‚Äôs this rude little girl‚Äôs job to make subs. I believe that‚Äôs what she gets paid to do. It‚Äôs not my fault the app didn‚Äôt allow me to pick a later time. Also I didn‚Äôt expect to be that late but got held up at an appointment. Pretty crappy customer service, not impressed."
"I was only going to order delivery from the app because of a promotional email I received from subway. The email stated ‚Äúno delivery fee‚Äù. While I was not charged a delivery fee, I was charged 2 other fees which amounted to 4 dollars. This was half the price of my footlong sub. Although I did feel, a bit hustled for basically gifting subway four dollars AND tipping the delivery girl, I decided to continue with my delivery order. I received the food and it was horrible. It was cold and soggy, missing some of the toppings I asked for and overall a big disappointment. Please stick to your brick and mortar model and stay out of the delivery business! I can luckily hop in my car and pop into a  subway store to get a sandwich (I won‚Äôt be doing that for a while), but please stop taking advantage of the people who can‚Äôt by overcharging them and giving them horrible quality products."
"Please beware that their customer service is all online. I emailed them about a store charging me for a sandwich that I didn‚Äôt receive. According to the store the order never went through and was supposed to be voided but my bank account was still charged. I emailed Subway‚Äôs customer report who responded with:

 I apologize that you had a negative experience with our app. I appreciate your feedback and can assure you the team that is responsible for the app has received this information and will take it into account, as we are always looking to improve the quality and functionality.

While I‚Äôm glad someone is working on it, I‚Äôd love for someone to look into refunding me my purchase. Until this is resolved I‚Äôm no longer eating at another Subway, but I doubt they really care about the consumer or the issues with their app."
"I‚Äôve only used this app once but it was for a pretty large order. I customized 5 different footlong sandwiches and added them to my cart, but upon checking out I was prompted with an error message along the lines of. ‚ÄúOrder cannot be processed at this time‚Äù. All of my cart items disappeared and so I would have had to re-do them all, had I decided to continue with this app. But my biggest qualm is that the app charged me for the order that didn‚Äôt go through. Also I tried using the ‚ÄúContact Us‚Äù in customer support and submitted an email explaining my issue but was never tended to.

I don‚Äôt mind that I was prompted with the error message upon checking out. I would love to use this app even if I experienced some minor technical issues but the fact that I might get charged for no reason is very concerning, especially without follow-up from customer support."
"It can be a convenient for me, especially when I work right across a subway so I can click on my favorite and quickly grab it on my lunch break. But the app is difficult to navigate since you have to go through so much ingredients for one sandwich. Also If you try to go back after adding one thing to the order it automatically submits. This happened to me last week after I realized I almost sent my order to the wrong location, but when I tried to go back to change it, the purchase automatically went through and I had to spend my lunch break talking to customer service to resolve the issue because the store didn‚Äôt cancel my order after they said it was. Customer service was really helpful but it would be great for them to resolve glitches and bugs asap. :)"
"Place my first order today... 
and it will be my last. It is unacceptable that you have a name on the product but you are not the responsible, i have to deal with the actual store and the owner of the store to see if i can get a refund. I place my order to the wrong store and according to customer service i could have avoided this problem if I had place it to the store, then i wouldn‚Äôt have a problem at all, like i mentioned before it was a mistake that i didn‚Äôt notice until i got to the store. They said you could have called and cancel that order, right if the employees at the store were to pick up the phone... I do my lunch order over the apps all the time and i guess when it come to subway it is not worth it... one mistake and they just take your money, not even offering credit to spend on your own business.... 
i can say i will no longe be a subway customer... 
what a disappointment"
"I will never use this app again. I ordered from my local Subway restaurant for a curbside order for a group. I get there, the restaurant didn‚Äôt have my order.. They refused to give me the food and refused to give me a refund. I had to race around to two different restaurant to quickly get everyone‚Äôs food. Subway later contacted me and claimed I went to the wrong subway. They claimed that the food was ready for me at the restaurant and they also claimed I did NOT speak to a man at their restaurant. ‚Ä¶.The Subway I ordered from is the only one around and I‚Äôm positive that I heard and saw a man‚Ä¶ Unfortunately, there is nowhere in the app to get my money back and Subway customer service was less than informed or willing to accommodate for their inconvenience frustrating error. I ended up having to start a claim with my bank to get my money back. Needless to say, Jimmy John‚Äôs sounds better for now."
"I used the Subway app, and included specific directions/ notes for the Subway employees who claimed they didn‚Äôt received those directions. They showed me a receipt that appeared to be the app order. 
My sandwiches were not toasted, and in my family this is a big deal. My daughters don‚Äôt like the BMT cold.  I ate my sandwich cold, but my girls just couldn‚Äôt. They can‚Äôt pepperoni and salami cold, and I don‚Äôt blame them. I hate them cold too. I used the app feature to indicate that I wanted them toasted; and I also added a note on the directions‚Äô section. 

I was in a rush and I had to spend an extra 15 min in the store to buy a toasted sandwich.
The problem was NOT with the employees, (they were very nice) but the communication between the app and the subway employees (as they mentioned that this is not the first time that this happens, and they even suggested to place the order on the phone next time)."
I never leave reviews but since the app has no way to contact customer service or some kind of help on the app this will do. After ordering on the app I went in the store and they say they didn‚Äôt get the order and there‚Äôs no way of them giving me a refund. Even though I showed the store my order she just said I don‚Äôt have it on my computer I can‚Äôt make it then proceeding to tell me to get my money back I go on the app and then once I go on the app it tells me I should call the store to cancel the order when the store told me they cannot give me a refund through that way. I understand that this could be a common technical problem that my order didn‚Äôt get to the restaurant but the app has no convenient way to be able to contact someone about this in the store wasn‚Äôt willing to help or work with me. So now I am hungry and $30 Down the drain.
"Every time I have used the app I land up spending more time than a phone call order or in person order. When I want to place 2 - 4 customized subs in an order, the place order button gets disabled with no description when there are more than one sub to the bag. Hate the app. I was able to place the same subs as individual orders. So annoying and time wasting.  Even the f I change the order pick up time the button remains disabled.

 And then there is the inventory issue: it said a store didn‚Äôt have mustard and another one doesn‚Äôt have salt. I have easily subways 100 or more subways in 6 different countries in the past. I have never been to a store that doesn‚Äôt have salt. Makes no sense what so ever.

Favorites, says some ingredients are not available, why not tell which ones? And let me decide to continue without those or change the store."
"So today I came home to some very awesome coupons for subway being that I don‚Äôt drive I was telling myself I‚Äôd have to wait until tomorrow to get subway but I definitely upset about having to wait because I am craving it now..
After checking out all the coupons I seen that they not only had curbside pick up but NOW THEY HAVE DELIVERY!! when I tell you I was ecstatic and the fact that you earn points was an awesome plus. As we all love a good deal/saving/getting points at a place that we actually use!!! I am going 5 stars for this app because I‚Äôve been waiting a longggggg time to be able to have SUBWAY DELIVERED TO MY DOORSTEP.. Big thanks to the CREATORS üòç"
"Works great. 
Except 2 things. 
So glad you accept Apple pay now!!
1) It rejects PayPal, even though it used to accept it. Best to just not offer PayPal as a form of payment, than to make customer go through the hassle of setting it up only to reject it. 
2) Currently, making an order a favorite is very cumbersome. It‚Äôs per item, rather than entire order. And only after checkout. Let customer set an order as favorite before they place order, as well as afterwards. I see the favorite heart shaped button there during placing order, it should be used to make the current order a favorite or go to the list of favorites."
"The app gets the job done and can‚Äôt complain about rewards. A couple things need work. If you add a gift card, once the value drops below the price of what you‚Äôre trying to purchase, you can‚Äôt place an order by combing your gift card and other form of payment. When you pay, there‚Äôs quite a delay which might make you think your payment didn‚Äôt go through so you attempt to pay for a second time. There‚Äôs a little too much on the apps page, it‚Äôs a little confusing. Also, depending on where you order from, some places will make your order and let it sit there so by the time you arrive at the designated time, your sandwich is soggy."
"Suggested changes:
Please add all the choices please. Since you know which store the person is ordering from you should be able to show things like the brown mustard the one I order my sandwich‚Äôs from carries so I can order it on there instead of showing up early to have them substitute. Also half half options like the pizza apps allow so when you are splitting a sub between two kids they can pick their own toppings (example my youngest loves olives on hers and her sister won‚Äôt eat her side if it even had one on it). It would be nice if you could add soup (although I could see why this would be tricky) and the specialty cookies maybe with a back up option if it‚Äôs not currently available. Otherwise it‚Äôs a decent enough app."
"The app lags when exiting and entering the app the splash screen logo lags has a slight delay this could be improved with debugging as well as the app feeling slightly sluggish when taping on options sometimes you have to press twice or harder to select something I also wish mainly just an improvement fix for me when you click on show card it automatically turns your brightness all way up which can be nauseating to those of us that prefer our phones darker/dimly lit 

On a side note I wish as a neat feature it would keep your lifetime order history like a full receipt with what was purchased for order going back to 1-3 months or so but a less detailed overview of all orders made with your account such as a line with order total and date transaction was made and which location ‚Äîjust some suggestions"
"I like using this app and the option of ordering online and picking it up. That part is fast and convenient. 2 things I wish could change:
1. You can only save an order to ‚Äúfavorites‚Äù right after checking out. If you forget, it‚Äôs no longer an option to save the order. I never remember to do this when I‚Äôm in a hurry and have had to re-build my order each time I use the app. 
2. I wish there was a way to combine payment methods. I have a gift card that has $6 and change left on it. My order is usually more than that amount. Because of this, I can‚Äôt use the gift card at all via the app. It won‚Äôt let me use the balance and combine it with another method of payment."
"I was asked, are you enjoying our app? I hit ""not really."" A message popped up. ""Oh no! Do you want to tell us about your experience?"" I didn't really, but I thought I would help out and hit yes. The next message popped up: ""Do you want to call support?"" The only answers available were Call and Cancel. So basically, this app has been designed to make sure no one complains.

What did I want to complain about in the first place? It took four tries to place an order after I accidentally tried to use a card without money on it. ""This order has been errored and can't continue"" the message went, even after I put money on the card; even after I added a new card; even after I deleted the order and reordered from scratch. In the end I had to delete the app and start over with a new password. Extremely annoying. Wasted 30 minutes.

Also annoying: constantly being asked to save favorite sandwiches, going through the trouble of naming them, and then being told the app can't save them because I've reached my limit. The app shouldn't ask me to save them if that's true.

Also annoying, every time I hit Reorder I get an error message.

This app is pretentious and arrogant."
"I love Subway stores and I regularly order sandwiches there. I used the app and had started to earn a few $2 coupons. With a group of friends, I suggested using my app to scan for each of our purchases to earn points towards the reward. After scanning for 4 individual sub orders, my account was frozen. The message is ‚ÄúSomething has gone wrong with your account, contact customer support‚Äù. I have looked all over the Subway website and have found no options in their contact us section regarding the app, and the FAQ section was of no help either. 

I am very disappointed by the decision to not include a phone number anywhere on the app or website to talk to a customer service representative. 

Subway is a great place to get sandwiches, but the corporate decisions made concerning the app and customer service are cheap and effortless."
The only issue I have is pretty huge and that is the special instructions needs to be in red bold whatever I ask for Guacamole on side and every time I go pickup they‚Äôve put it on the tuna sub which I hate to but have to wait for them to remake I usually split the footlong with my hubby who doesn‚Äôt like guacamole so it really does defeat the purpose of having it ready for pickup when you have to sit wait while it‚Äôs being remade and they get annoyed as they always say it three or four times but it‚Äôs already made I get it but it‚Äôs their mistake not mine I feel guilty then and now I‚Äôve made them mad but for the last few weeks I‚Äôve been there pretty much every day ordering the same order you‚Äôd think by now they‚Äôd get it
"It was super easy to navigate and order, once you get the gist of it. At first I didn‚Äôt know what I was doing, but it was like one of those cooking games. I found it amusing to order. I only tried it once so far for the buy one get one free order. I read that the app didn‚Äôt work for some. Everything worked so far for me. One feature I did not like is, you have to add gift cards a head of time and they verify that it loaded to your account through your email and then you can resume checking out in the app. The Target app lets you just add the gift card and pay instantly, whereas this one makes you wait for an email to be sent to you."
"I‚Äôm a frequent subway buyer, and using the app is convenient for quick pickups on my lunch break. It‚Äôs a very user friendly and visually appealing app that makes it easy to access deals and use rewards. 

However, it‚Äôs about a 50/50 toss up between whether the app will actually submit your order. When it doesn't work, I just get error messages that offer no solution. After messing with it and realizing it‚Äôs a day it‚Äôs just not going to work, I sometimes attempt to use the very frustrating online ordering, which glitches way more than the app, or I just give up. 

It appears not everyone experiences this, so it‚Äôs definitely still worth downloading to see if you‚Äôre one of the lucky ones."
"The user interface is very well designed and easy for anyone to grasp and understand. The customizable options for the sandwiches are pleasant and well thought out, it all makes for a clean look with a great user experience. This is by far the best sandwich app I have installed on my phone in the last day or two. Plus the 5 dollar deal really makes for a good incentives download and use as a gateway to be exposed to the fantastic app. Overall my day has been made brighter by the app and I don‚Äôt think I will ever look at subway the same. Subway I am now talking to you directly, thank you so much I will cherish this forever."
After a loonnng hiatus from this app due to it being complete garbage I finally decide to give it another chance. Decent updates but not the most user-friendly. The biggest issue is that the bread selection doesn‚Äôt show up on your sandwich maker‚Äôs end so I show up to just grab n go and later find out when I go to eat lunch that it‚Äôs the wrong bread. Check the receipt to see if it was my entry error or the sandwich maker‚Äôs. The bread selection doesn‚Äôt even show. Really? Most of your bread is garbage so I go for the flatbread (still not a great product but better than the others). So today I added it to the notes section to be sure. The sandwich maker thanked me as he admitted there‚Äôs been nothing but problems and the bread doesn‚Äôt show on his end. How do you guys miss that part? I mean isn‚Äôt the bread the most important part?
"App randomly picks different breads based on sandwich, instead of all defaulting to one bread type or asking every time.  I ordered 3 different sandwich types and got different bread than expected.

The graphical sandwich builder makes it hard to see that the bread type is not what I wanted.  The graphical builder also doesn't pick default veggie choices automatically that you would get at store (for instance pickles are normally the default all veggies, but not selected in the app).  Being able to disable the graphical builder and just checkbox the items would be better, it would be more clear which veggies are missing from the default.

The receipt the store gets does not clearly indicate how many drinks (and size) and what flavor cookies and chips, so the store ended up shorting me a drink (insisting I was wrong), and had to verify receipt for me to get the chips/cookies."
"I am a frequent customer of Subway. Some of the time the app works great. However, whenever there is a special promotion, like 10% off any item, the app is full of glitches and doesn‚Äôt apply the discount. I just wasted 15 minutes of my day ordering, trying to apply the promotion, and then getting to the screen and having the promotion not work. Then I tried to reorder. No dice. It‚Äôs complete garbage. This also happens when there is something like free chips or a free cookie with the purchase of a foot-long sub. I am sorry, but it‚Äôs 2020 and there is no excuse for a company to have an app that is this poor. Again, I wasted 15 minutes of my day trying to apply a 10% off discount only to have it not work. I tried at least five different times. Forget it. I‚Äôm not using this app anymore. I guess I‚Äôm going to have Dominos today."
"The app is easy to make your sandwich exactly like you want it. The graphics are great too. The payment part is super frustrating though. If you want to pay with a gift card that you have downloaded it will not let you pay the rest with a debit card. Also, you cannot combine gift cards. I ended up with 3 partially used gift cards and no way to use them. Even when I went into the store to use them I could only use one and had to pay my remaining balance with cash. I still have 2 partially used gift cards with no way to use them on the app. This needs to be fixed on the app and in stores. I did email Subway about this awhile ago with no response."
"I have tried to use the app multiple times to take advantage of a deal that is going on. I have the same issue as another user who posted. It adds an extra sub regularly and I am not sure why. I have to be diligent and be sure to check the cart and delete the extra items that have been added. Once I go to submit payment I receive a message that stated the following:

Cannot read property ‚Äòupdate‚Äô of undefined

At this point I am unable to go any further and am not able to place my order. I do have a screen shot I can share if that would help the developers! I like subway but the app is not worth the hassle until some bugs get fixed. Hopefully that gets taken care of as there are soon good deals I would like to take advantage of."
"I ordered from this app and paid through PayPal. I got a notice of payment from PayPal that was overcharging me. I went into the app to see what was going on only to see it had voided my order. When I looked further, it showed my order as being placed but it doubled the food. I tried to call the store to sort it out. No one answered. I went there and was told it‚Äôs my problem and not their problem. I offered to show him the PayPal receipt on my phone. He just kept saying it wasn‚Äôt his problem. I called the customer service number and was told that for ‚Äúmy convenience‚Äù I could only contact customer service electronically. I tried electronic methods and got zero response from Subway. I tried another store and was basically told it wasn‚Äôt their problem. Meanwhile I‚Äôm out money for food I never received. I deleted this app and won‚Äôt be going back to Subway."
"I have ordered from this app several times and half the time my order does not even go through to the location I am heading to. The staff at the subway knows the app is awful and makes the sandwich anyway but any deals the app offers, such as buy 1 get 1 free will not be applied. If I have to explain that my card has been charged and then stand there waiting for my meal to be prepared it defeats the purpose of ordering ahead of time. If the order does by by some miracle get placed at the location I am heading to it will be missing items that I have already paid for. It seems like a scam to offer discounts and then charge somebody full price. How this app has 4.8 rating is insane to me. If I could give it zero stars I would. Save yourself some time and hassle by just going in the store or going to Jimmy Johns instead. Absolute garbage."
"I can‚Äôt put more than one sandwich on an order with out having to do it NINE TIMES. You can‚Äôt get any of the selections you want right, and all the sandwiches are in the wrong spot. The concept of the app is fine. What it has become is a nightmare. When you try to tap a place you want to eat on the map, it switches back to the location your home town is. Oh nice. I TRIED to have my order made in Detroit, but the FREAKING map made the order go to MISSISSIPPI. I‚Äôm sick of this bull crap. You guys have the time to make little gifs of cars going up and down on hills but you can‚Äôt make an app that FREAKING WORKS.  Kick your 5000 people out of the ‚ÄúCutesy Graphics‚Äù department, and hire some engineers who are going to make the app function properly. YOU KILLED THE APP. I don‚Äôt know how much money you all spent updating this app from its already perfect version, but whatever you spent, it wasn‚Äôt worth it. Please fix it."
Hopefully you get this message my name is Jeffrey I‚Äôm in Pastry Chef down here in Miami used to be I noticed four different subways are closing down because I think you guys need new ideas you should  come out with the box . 5 dollar specials are great but you  would only have people coming in for that only you need to have different things like I said the box having two different sandwiches something different sometimes a business I know people forget and that‚Äôs what I notice what‚Äôs going on but please don‚Äôt close down contact me if you need anything thank you so much.
"I‚Äôm a sandwich artist at Subway. SO MANY customers ask me to help them because the app always says they don‚Äôt have a valid phone number when signing up (most people order online while inside the store, in order to get online deals.) Another issue many customers have mentioned to me is that there‚Äôs no option to have certain vegetables/sauces on only one side of a footlong. I tell them to add it to the ‚Äúspecial notes‚Äù section of the payment, but customers get agitated. I think the app is great, I just hope those two issues get resolved!"
"I thought I‚Äôd try the app and today tried to order sandwiches with it. The immediate thing I disliked was having sandwiches ‚Äúprebuilt‚Äù (i.e., the turkey ham sandwich I wanted already was set up with certain ingredients). That‚Äôs an immediate pain in the behind because then I had to go in and remove everything that I didn‚Äôt like and then add things through the customize menu. It‚Äôd be a lot easier to simply start with the main ingredients (turkey and ham in my case) and then customize from there. I can‚Äôt imagine EVERYONE wants the ingredients you have the sandwich preset up for. Secondly, I had zero success getting the $5 deal listed if I was to order two of the sandwiches. Thirdly, the only option available to pay was through Apple Pay. At the end of the day, I decided the app is worthless and deleted it. Certainly doesn‚Äôt suit my needs."
"I ordered my lunch on the app and after I brought my food back to work, my coworker handed me my bag and I realized that subway had forgotten my bottle of water. So I went into the app to try and make a comment or something so I could get a refund, but there isn‚Äôt any option to do so. With any food ordering app I‚Äôve used, it‚Äôll normally have a ‚Äúreport a problem‚Äù or the app will ask you about your order and allow you to put in feedback. So the app got my order right and I got my sandwich, and I filled out the survey on the email, but it‚Äôs just a standard survey for everyone. There should be something within the app when you look at previous orders that allows you to submit a comment about an order."
Just got the app so that I can order something and go pick it up. After going through the headache of setting up an account‚Ä¶ Standard stuff... ordering a sandwich was way too complicated.. Wanted to make it a meal and there was no way to get a fountain drink. Had to go ahead and go with a bottled soda. Then I couldn‚Äôt place the order anyway because it wouldn‚Äôt take any payment method. There‚Äôs no option to pay in store. Mainly I was surprised because it wouldn‚Äôt let me pay with my card. So I got an app to make things simple and rather than going up to subway and taking the 5 to 10 minutes to place an order I had to spend 30 minutes or so setting this up to be rejected and still have to go up there and order like I don‚Äôt have the app. Waste of space on phone and at this point I‚Äôm so frustrated I think I‚Äôm just gonna take the 2 minutes to place an order on Taco Bell app.
"App was mostly user friendly.  When looking at the picture editing of the sub it doesn‚Äôt allow you to change the cheese type.  If you remove it you can add the cheese you want later, but the cost goes up.  However, if you hit the Plus at the bottom right, right away to add additional things, it lets you modify the cheese type that‚Äôs there for free in this screen.  I am not sure why you can‚Äôt change the cheese in the main picture edit screen like you can change the bread, but at least you can change it in the adds screen. Pretty good job Subway.  Please fix it so you can slide through the cheese options in the picture edit and my rating will change to 5 stars."
"This app has good intentions. However, the execution missed the mark. One of the beautiful things about subway is being able to walk in and customize a sandwich to your exact liking: protein, cheeses, add-ons, and sauces galore. That, unfortunately, is not the case here on the app. There are very few sandwiches to select from and what are available are set and fixed so if, for example, you choose a ham and cheese melt, it is impossible to add, say, turkey or bacon. There is also not a full list of sauces on the app. So you can add basic condiments like Mayo, mustard, oil and vinegar, but the fun ones such as creamy sriracha or southwest (etc) are not featured and available on the app. All in all, this is a big bust for my family. We will be having to go in and order to our liking until Subway works to make their app actually accessible."
I accidentally submitted an order. At the bottom of the confirmation page it says call the store to cancel your order. I called the store immediately. They told me they couldn‚Äôt cancel the order. I had to use the app. I explained to them that the app says to call them. They said sorry. I asked for a corporate number to call and explain the situation. There is no way to call them. I just submitted feedback for the store because that‚Äôs best I can do for now. This is a serious error in this app! I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôll ever use it to order again now that I lost money. Btw I was trying to see if a further store would honor the recent 2 foot longs for $5 each as the 2 closest to me never do. That‚Äôs how I accidentally order a sandwich. Thank God it wasn‚Äôt 2 sandwiches I ordered and won‚Äôt get. I hope subway returns my money.
"It looks like they tried to design a dating or social media app. The focus should on a simple efficient design to order a sandwich. Earlier versions were clearer, now it‚Äôs a bunch of flowery crap you have to scroll through to order. It‚Äôs also like a game (in a bad way) where you have to be careful what you touch because it will toss in a drink and chips into your order while all you want to do is change one ingredient. The only reason for using an app instead of ordering in person is because it is supposed to be faster and easier. The app in it‚Äôs current state does neither. The Panera app has considerably more options, yet is easier to maneuver through and edit an order. 

Other suggestions- let the app indicate that the store you want to order from is closed or having technical difficulties instead of the app crashing or a vague description pop-up."
"I‚Äôve wanted subway over a week. I just downloaded the app to order it. I didn‚Äôt get half my order cause they didn‚Äôt read the ticket, they admitted it was their fault. I‚Äôm pregnant and haven‚Äôt ate in over 24 hours and paid almost $20 for just a sandwich. They tell me I can come back and get my stuff that I‚Äôm supposed to get it myself unless I go through drivethru. Went through drive thru. They acted like they couldn‚Äôt do anything for me. This is the subway on Martin Luther king in Little Rock. There is no way to file a discrepancy on the app for something wrong. So how I‚Äôm out $7 for things I didn‚Äôt get. It may not seem like much to you but when you‚Äôre pregnant in a homeless shelter it adds up, every penny does and they weren‚Äôt very willing to fix the issue either even after I called twice. I will never use this app again not this location. It also won‚Äôt let me delete my cc."
"This app shows a buy 2 foot longs, get 1 free special (at participating stores), but it doesn‚Äôt bother to tell you if the store you have selected is participating in the promotion. You have to check your total to see if the discount applied. So, I wasted my time customizing 3 sandwiches just to find out that apparently my local store is not participating in this promotion. The app obviously knows that my store is not honoring the special, so why doesn‚Äôt it just say so. I guess they are taking advantage of the people who don‚Äôt check the total before they submit their order and ripping them off.

It also doesn‚Äôt allow multiple (split) payment methods. So if you have a gift card, but it doesn‚Äôt have enough on it to pay for the entire order, you are S.O.L. and have to select a different payment method.

I won‚Äôt be eating Subway tonight!"
"It does the job, but I have a few minor qualms with the application. First, changing the size of the sub completely resets all my other settings. Changing the size of an order shouldn‚Äôt reset all of the toppings. Instead, the app should make a reasonable assumption and keep all the toppings and just change the size. Second, the application performance could be better. I see the loading screen too often in this app. Perhaps there was a trade-off made to ensure the data is loaded independently for each location. Improved performance and more reasonable assumptions when changing order options would make this a five star app for me."
"Too many times have I gotten a call to pick up a sub I did not order or at least did not intend to order.
The place order button is exactly where you touch to scroll up to review the order, there is no check in there are no take backs. This app is horribly flawed especially since, at least in Chicago, 90% of the restaurants do not offer whatever promotion the app offers but you need to review the order to find that out and if you‚Äôre not careful when you try to review it you will place it and not all the restaurants have working phone numbers.
And why must it clear the cart in order to change restaurants? I‚Äôll tell you, because every restaurant charges something different for the same items. So why can‚Äôt the app figure that out and just modify the prices without emptying the cart."
"Maybe I missed it, but after I paid there was a tab that said place order so I clicked it. Nothing was shown about time. Did a little shopping and thought my 2 sandwiches would be ready. Went to subway and they hadn‚Äôt even received the order. No other customers were in the store so I showed my confirmation and asked if she could make the sandwiches and she said no she had to wait for her receipt. By then I noticed my pickup time was 1:20 and it was 1:07. I placed the order around 12:40. I asked for the manager and another woman came out. I explained, showed her my confirmation and she said she would get the manager. By then 2 more customers came in then my order came in. They made and did a good job but not the best experience."
"Whether it‚Äôs the ridiculously wrong wait times (who staffs 1 person to work Friday night around dinner time??? Had to wait an hour outside the shop for an order to get done. Nevermind the people waiting in line to get a sandwich made. Or placing an order only to get a phone call that they are out of everything (but the app didn‚Äôt tell you that, right?). OR, and this is the most annoying, getting ready to order and just getting the annoying little red triangle saying ‚Äúsome ingredients may not be available.‚Äù What ingredients??? A sauce??? The meat??? Bread??? You‚Äôll never know because there‚Äôs NO details included in this warning. I guess you just don‚Äôt get to enjoy your sandwich. You would‚Äôve been waiting an hour for it anyway."
"I ordered twice on this app. The first time, the order was wrong when it arrived, but I still enjoyed the meal so I didn‚Äôt make a fuss. The second time, as soon as I placed the order it marked it as delivered and charged me the full amount. I never got my sandwiches and was out $20 plus the tip for the ‚Äúdriver‚Äù. I went through the long process of where to send an email and tracked down which version of the app I had, which iOS, and which store the order had gone to (the number to call never answered) and just got a reply stating that they would inform their team of the issue. I replied requesting a refund or store credit, but never got a reply. I actually like Subway, so I might have kept the app for when I am in person, but the delivery experience and customer service prompted me to warn you all away."
"I placed an order on Subways app and got to the payment screen. The payment began to process but then the app glitched and an error screen popped up telling me to replace the order. My cart was completely cleared out, so I checked my bank to ensure it wasn‚Äôt charged, but it had been. There was no record of the order in my order history and I wasn‚Äôt sent an email confirmation. I tried to contact the store who also didn‚Äôt receive an order and refused to make my food without an order confirmation even though I could show them the charges. On top of it all, Subway doesn‚Äôt have any live through customer service anymore. It‚Äôs entirely automated so I‚Äôm just screwed out of my money. DO NOT TRUST THE APP because of it messes up the company will not take any responsibility for the malfunction."
"My first time on the app!! While trying to order the app ask if I was a member or wanted to be (my wording!). Even though I‚Äôve been getting e-mails from Subway I don‚Äôt ever remember joining with a password & I write ALL my Passwords down in a ‚Äúspecial‚Äù notebook. But when I push I want to join, a message comes up that there is someone else with that same email (me)!! Looked through my notebook and no Subway password!!! Low and behold I can not get off that page!! So go into I‚Äôm already a member with my email and push ‚Äúforgot my password‚Äù - it throws me to a page that up in the left hand side of the page in the smallest letters I‚Äôve ever seen say ‚Äúwrong page‚Äù (again my wording cuz it was 3 hours ago and I was so mad I was ready to throw my phone across the room!!). And this is why I don‚Äôt use these stupid Apps everyone has."
"Honestly I love subway because it not a bad meal, but ordering with this app is so painful. 1. The only way to save a favorite is to actually order it. When it say create a favorite I have to order it from a specific store. 2. Very difficult to traverse back and fourth from the veggie/meat menu if I want to add something. 3. Getting bread toasted and change bread is hard to spot and easy to forget it‚Äôs like your trying to hide it from us. Unlike the store they always ask would you like your bread toasted? And then when I arrive I don‚Äôt get what I want and it‚Äôs pretty disappointing. Of course not all your guys fault since i‚Äôm the one who didn‚Äôt press that option but I feel like you guys can make it better. There‚Äôs more but can‚Äôt think of it right now"
"I downloaded the app last night and we submitted 4 subs for an order. Get to the end (after it processes payment) and it said ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre sorry, but this store can not accept your order at this time.‚Äù Clicked ‚Äúokay,‚Äù tried again. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre sorry, but this store can not accept your order at this time.‚Äù So my husband just went to the store to order and bring back food. I get a call an hour later from Subway saying, ‚ÄúYes ma‚Äôam, your order is here waiting for you, we just wanted to be sure you knew to pick it up.‚Äù What!?!?

And apparently Subway restaurants cannot cancel orders placed on the mobile app (even after it tells you that the order was never placed to begin with.) So now I‚Äôve paid for 12 subs and am waiting on a call back from the store owner.... a day later. Yeah right. 

I would not trust this app again."
"Great Update: Being able to select Easy on the different toppings is very helpful and favorites has become much better. Also now you can select sauces, the workers don‚Äôt always look at the receipt for sauces, but it‚Äôs still early for the changes still and I‚Äôm sure some people might change there mind. Thanks for the awesome update. Great step forward!

Update: Finally got access to my account again after 9 weeks of not being able to get in. Only after writing the Beware on my review. So I had a week turn around on getting my account access back after giving a bad review.

Beware: I have been locked out of my account for 2 months now. Trying to get back in to it to no avail. I try the forgot password and it won‚Äôt send me the email, yet they continually send me promotional emails. I had 2 rewards, but by now they are probably expired. The contact form for support never appears to work, for me at least. I don‚Äôt get a confirmation that I submitted a support ticket or any notifications that I will be contacted. I can‚Äôt resign up with Facebook or my email because they are both already being used. So, as I have said to support. I‚Äôm not buying anymore Taco Bell until I can have access to my account. I had all my favorites set up and I was happy. Now, my disappointment is immeasurable and my rest of the year has been ruined."
"I have never had so many problems with an online app as I did with Taco Bell‚Äôs app. On Thursday May 24th I made an online order for this store location 330 w northside dr Jackson ms. I submitted  the order over thirty minutes before arriving to the location because I made a stop prior to arriving.  The money for my order was taken from my account and when I got to the window I was yelled at and told that I could not have my food (that I had paid for) that they didn‚Äôt see any order or money. They yelled at me and made me leave the drive thru. They told me they have nothing to do with the ‚Äúraggedy‚Äù app. I left and went down the road to call the customer service number for a resolution . The rep answers the phone sounding sleepy and  nonchalant. She told me there was nothing she could do. It was the apps fault . That I have to wait 3 business days before I can be refunded. I called again today , Tuesday ! And was told that a refund has been requested that now I need to wait 6-10 business days for the app to refund me! I will never use this App again in my life . Thanks Taco Bell for what has been the worst fast food experience of my life ! Delete this app ! Everyone do not use it !!  I promise you‚Äôll run into an issue ."
"I wrote a snarky review about how much the app would lock up, and how buggy the checkout process was. I‚Äôm really glad to see that the new version of the app is *far* superior on both fronts!

I still have to knock a star off for the fact that certain screens‚Äîespecially the Customize screens‚Äîcan appear to fail when you open them. They are actually just loading, and dutifully populate the views after they‚Äôre done, but they are not reporting any status or progress and it makes it feel like the app is frozen or has hit an error, which isn‚Äôt great.

Also, this is just an opinion, but I think it‚Äôs odd that ordering for in-store pickup indicates that they start preparing the order right away, but ordering for drive-thru indicates that they wait for me to be on-site and check in before the order is prepared. It seems like I‚Äôd always want to choose in-store pickup, so they can prepare it while I‚Äôm driving there, or at least have advance notice of the order to save a little time on both sides, and I‚Äôm confused why the drive-thru doesn‚Äôt use the same logic... Maybe the higher likelihood of being forced to wait for a long drive-thru line...? Only one transaction-spot to receive the food in the drive-thru, versus potentially multiple points in-store? I assume it was a deliberate choice. Just interesting, I guess. Other apps use GPS to detect when you‚Äôre nearly at the restaurant for that kind of thing, could be a good feature."
This app is by far one of the worst apps for a food establishment. I like being able to pay contactless when I eat out nowadays and also have the convenance of having it ready to pick up. The app was already buggy while trying to add items and once I got to checkout it decided to give me an error message as soon as it took my Apple Pay stating ‚Äúsorry something went wrong...‚Äù BUT STILL CHARGED MY CARD with no order placed or history of a order placed ( I called to make sure that the location I was trying to place pick up did or did not receive any order under my name). This is ridiculous and an overall terrible experience. They make it so difficult to even find where / how contact the support. Luckily after some googling I was able to get hopefully somewhere via sending an email. Their number is only available from 8am-4pm what about ‚Äúafter hours‚Äù as most people eat dinner after 6pm or 7pm! Plus I saw the wide spread issue discussed that I am having with having your card charged without an order placed or being able to pick up the food you paid for. I will be uninstalling the app / not be using the app + suggesting that others do the same. Waste of your time and money. Also an additional side note why the did you take away all the things people actually enjoyed eating from Taco Bell with weak overhyped replacements. The fiesta potatoes + pico de gallo were literally one of the reasons I went to Taco Bell instead of Del Taco.
"This is the worst app I have ever used. Multiple issues with this app. It looks like it saves my card information for convenient purchasing but when I go to make the purchase it gives me an error saying something went wrong. In order to make the purchase, it makes me then re-enter my card info then it works. I have to do this every time. After while, I end up with my card info in there 10 times and have to go through and delete them. The other issue I have had is with getting locked out. It tells me it‚Äôs time to change my password. It asks me to click a link to send me an email to update my password. Even though my email is correct in there and I receive all the rewards/marketing emails, I never receive the link to reset my password. Now I can‚Äôt even use the app anymore at all to make purchases or access my rewards. I have tried to go into the app to use the contact messaging features and have asked for either a phone call or email follow up. No surprise, I never receive a call or email in regard to getting assistance with my issues. Of course, the app is third party and no one in any of the locations, including managers can assist or give me any phone number to contact for assistance. I never have issues with any other food apps. Very poor customer experience and due to all the inconvenience, I just go elsewhere instead. Would love for someone to contact me or for them to fix their app."
"I've tried using this app 3 times. The first two times I selected which location I wanted it at and somewhere along the way it chose a different store across town and I didn't find out until I was at the one I wanted to order from. I even payed special attention the second time to make sure it wasn't user error and it still somehow changed it. I waited in a 30 minute line twice both times because the service was slow and I didn't find out that it wasn't at that location until I was at the window. That's 2 hours of waiting overall for a taco! If it wasn't too late to have gone inside to get it but at that point only the drive thru was open. The third time I tried using it wasn't as bad but I like jalepenos so I tried adding them to my order and the option was there but every time I tried selecting it, it either didn't even show that I tried adding them but every now and then it would show it checked off for a split second before unchecking itself, I tried it with multiple different food items to make sure it wasn't just that my item couldn't have jalepenos added to it. It wouldn't let me add it to a single item. And I can't find any explanation for it. This app is supposed to make ordering easier but it's done nothing but add 10 times more stress to trying to get food. The restaurants weren't at all helpful when I explained the situation. At this point in about ready to give up on taco bell altogether and use the mcdonalds app next time."
"I‚Äôve had the app for the longest time to keep up with their menu changes; unfortunately, it doesn‚Äôt provide an updated menu (at least for my area). As a result, despite the store no longer offering a limited item on the menu, they still offer it in the app. I figured: maybe it‚Äôs just an incentive from ordering from the app? Not that it matters, b.c I hate how every fast food restaurant wants you to preload your payment methods. Still, I got taco bell gift cards recently, so I decided to order their cravings box. This particular limited item is only available through the app. I decided I‚Äôd preload my gift cards onto the app to try to get this item; unfortunately, the app wouldn‚Äôt even accept my order submission. The store I went to most definitely took online orders, but it seems their system likes to act up. It was already annoying that they made the item only accessible through the app, but when their system decides ‚Äògo to the next taco bell to get this item instead‚Äô, I may as well just uninstall the app from my phone at this rate, and spare myself the inconvenience. Thus, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôll do. Seriously, considering all of the above, what the heck is it good for? Compared to all of the restaurants with apps, this one seems to be among the most meaningless ones to have‚Ä¶ Taco bell had literal years to win me over with the app, and I genuinely wanted them to; regrettably, it‚Äôs just an outright disappointment I refuse to entertain any further."
"Let me start by saying I have used many different apps through the App Store for food services and restaurants. This app, by far, has caused me the most headache for trying to figure out what I want to eat. The first thing that happens when opening the app is it displays an error message stating ‚ÄúOops! Well this is embarrassing...‚Äù the message goes on for longer. It leaves me with a button to go to the home page. I press the button and does just that. At the home page, or menu as it takes me to, if I click on any category of food so I can figure out what I want to eat, it displays the same error and takes me back to the menu. The only way I can get to see the menu is the top slide bar with the categories. By the time I figure out what I want, I could have ordered at the drive-thru and paid. Since I have been experiencing this flaw since installing, I have never used the app to order food. Other apps have given me such great results and streamlined the ordering process, unfortunately, this app is an inconvenience. I truly refuse to use the app as I have been having many issues. If this is how a more personalized experience feels then it is a disgrace to have this app anywhere near my phone. Two stars for a review is being generous. The reason for two is I was able to still find what I wanted to eat, but nothing else redeems the rest of the stars."
"Update: I was finally able to reset password, store connectivity seems to be up and running again. Moved to 4 stars until the app proves it will work seamlessly again like it did the first two weeks after downloading... if no more issues will move to 5!

Original: This app is fantastic... until it kicks you off and won‚Äôt let you back on. I guess I was using it too frequently! Seriously though, the app is attractive, user friendly, and dangerous for late night cravings. However, on trying to order one night from the same store I had used it for many times before, upon checkout/submit order it told me that the connection with store was lost. I thought this to be a mistake so I tried again, and again, and again. I was starting to get nervous that maybe my order was going through and just getting run over and over. But that was not the case. Using Apple Pay, none went through but what was worse, it logged me out of the app, I couldn‚Äôt remember my password, and then the forget password functionality told me user access denied. I can‚Äôt get back into the app... I‚Äôm in the phantom zone! Taco Bell is easily losing $15/wk keeping me out of the app. Please fix this bug!!!"
"Unfortunately there‚Äôs no way to give this app zero stars, or I would. Had the app a couple years ago, and was triple charged on the app for a $50ish order, then reassured that two of the charges would be refunded. Didn‚Äôt happen until extensive phone calls were made, so I deleted the app, no big deal. I figured, as a year or so went by, the bugs would be worked out, and got the app again last year. Couldn‚Äôt log into my account, or even create a new account. Deleted again. Today, I decided to try it again. Surprise surprise. Can‚Äôt log into or create an account, and now the app won‚Äôt even allow me to select a location to start. If I‚Äôm the only one, then awesome. Keep up the hard work, but if this is a common occurrence, why even have the app available to the public? Hope this review helps, and best wishes to the developers!

Update: I decided to give the app another shot today. It worked great for us this time so I wanted to be fair and not leave the rating at one star. Developers, whatever you did, great work! Please keep it up, as we look forward to continuing its use. Thank you!"
"The interface is very touchy and the screen jumps all over the place. It finds my closest Taco Bell. I eventually manage to order my food. It takes my email, phone number and credit card. It tells me my food will be ready in 10 min. My credit card is charged but no email receipt. So I wait. Nothing. I arrive more than 15 min after the charge hit my credit card. No order. No food. An employee tells me I need to log into my account to show her the order. I showed her the app. It does not ask for a password or name, just email, phone and credit card.  Only the email can be used but a password is needed. The manager tells me I cannot get food because I have no receipt and I cannot get a refund because I ordered through the app and not his store. I have to take it up with customer support. Fine. It‚Äôs at this point when I realized if I reopened my app, as if to start a new order it saved my info. But it shows no order. Whatever.  I‚Äôm hungry, I‚Äôm here. I go to the register and repeat my order to the woman at the register, she stops me and tells me one of the meals I ordered doesn‚Äôt exist. In the app, for this particular store, there was a meal containing 2 chalupa supremes, a taco and a drink. So I asked about it again as it is also offered on Taco Bell‚Äôs website. The cashier‚Äôs words were ‚Äúthat combo does not exist in any Taco Bell anywhere‚Äù‚Äùthere is no Taco Bell where you can order that.‚Äù
So I left without food that I already paid for."
"I decided to open up my Taco Bell app and give it a try. I‚Äôve had it for a long while but just didn‚Äôt use it. First things first‚Ä¶ completely new app. No big deal. I wasn‚Äôt to familiar with the old app. I knew I had an account. Go to sign in and it says access denied. Go to recover my password and it says something similar. So I thought maybe new app new log in. Go to create, email is in use.  Delete the app and reinstall. Now it‚Äôs working and we‚Äôre logged in! I use a lot of apps to order but this one didn‚Äôt feel user friendly to me at all. I finally found the coupons. There‚Äôs one for 15% off. Great! How hard can this be‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre just ordering some food after all. I clicked on the grande box. The one with tacos and burritos. Get the burritos in, everything‚Äôs going smoothly. Go to the tacos. Soft tacos. I needed these to be customized three different ways. Put the first one in. Go to start the second specialty set. It‚Äôs lumping those with the first soft tacos I set up. I deleted and tried again. I repeated this process several times before showing my IT boyfriend the issue I was experiencing. I wanted to make sure I was doing it right. Yep. I was doing it right. Again and again. After about the sixth try I gave up. We aren‚Äôt a family who will all eat the same type of soft taco. So no 15% off for me. Nope. Why you ask‚Ä¶ because I went through the drive through. Coupon states only good for mobile or online ordering."
"I‚Äôve been using this app regularly for about a year due to COVID, but there are always glitches going on. First, my past orders never show up in the past orders section. Second, I often order the same things with the same modifications. I have saved these items as favorites, but they never appear under my favorites section. But when I try to add them as a favorite again, I‚Äôm told it‚Äôs already a favorites item. So instead of making it easier on me, I have to go through the hassle of adding the same modifications every single time. Third, it saves my card info without asking me if I want it to save. And if the card info is already saved, it will still save it as a new card...so the same card is listened multiple times. I don‚Äôt want my card info saved at all so I always have to go in and delete them. Last, for the last 2 or so months, reward points stopped working for me- but I‚Äôm still getting emails about having points to use up before the expire. 

I keep my app updated in hopes the glitches will get fixed, but it‚Äôs been almost a year for most of them and I‚Äôm just annoyed about it. I still use the app to order because I like that I‚Äôm having as little contact with people as possible so we can be safe, but having the same minor inconveniences for so long is very irritating."
"I‚Äôve been using the taco bell app for some time now and it makes eating there much more convenient; having access to the online exclusive items is a big plus as well as being able to save favorite items and orders for future visits so I don‚Äôt have to keep telling them the specifics of what I want.

However, just recently I spontaneously got locked out of my account on the app and every time I try to log in it says ‚Äúlog in failed.‚Äù I know for a fact that I put my information in correctly as I have the information saved to my device and have not touched it since I made my account. I looked it up and apparent this is a common issue. 

This is very disappointing, especially since some people have been locked out of their accounts for weeks, even months. I hope this does not happen for myself or for others from this point on, but if it is occurring (which if it‚Äôs happening to me then it‚Äôs likely happening to others) often then I will not be using the app any longer, which is unfortunate because I often utilize everything from the favorites to the notifications for deals as well as the rewards (ESPECIALLY THE REWARDS!!) Please fix this issue."
"First, the app isn't optimized for iPhone 6 or 7 plus models and the widescreen resolution is kinda annoying. Second, submitting an order vs. ""checking in"" at the pickup location don't always sync well. It tells you to wait until you arrive, but there's often 10+ min delay between my check-in time and when the order finally queues at the restaurant. Kinda defeats the purpose of the app's supposed convenience and time-saving abilities lol. Third, there is nowhere in-app to add special instructions or requests for the order (i.e. extra sour cream on the side). You have to make those requests at the restaurant, but adding a simple instruction at TB is like asking them to perform brain surgery. And when you tell them you want the extra items on the side (which you already paid for in-app) 99% of the time they charge me AGAIN at the window. Lastly, the app should decrease the odds of TB screwing up the order since I'm placing it myself and making sure it's correct. And yet they NEVER get it correct lol don't seem to have this issue at other restaurant apps (chipotle, subway, etc.) & I've tried at numerous TB locations, so it's super frustrating. The app works well for most part but the human element in-store is still a massive problem."
"I used to use this app back when it actually worked, but at some point they did an update or something and it made me have to sign back in. Normally this wouldn‚Äôt be a big deal but when I tried signing back in it wouldn‚Äôt let me no matter if I did it through Facebook or email. If I tried signing in through Facebook it would pop up asking if I‚Äôd like to allow it, I say yes, Facebook thing pops up, accept, back to Taco Bell app, and then it just has a red banner at the top that says ‚Äúlogin failed‚Äù (or something like that). It always does that and never goes any further. If I try logging in through email it says I‚Äôve made too many attempts and need to reset my password. Annoying but whatever. I go through all the steps for that until I get to the step of selecting a new password. I type it in and hit continue and it just sits there for a bit kinda like its trying but then just goes back to being a button for u to select to continue and NEVER gets passed that. I like to get Taco Bell breakfast stuff almost every morning but with this SIMPLE feature STILL not fixed after MANY MONTHS of it being like this I might just go somewhere else where I can order something and have it ready as expected...guys, please fix this...it should be REALLY simple...I have iPhone X and this app is the only one that ever gives me problems like this, really not thinking my phone is the issue here -.-"
"I have tried to place an order several times and found that the store i was trying to order from had no pick up times available, so I cannot complete the order.  On several occasions, I am sitting in the parking lot of the store because it has taken the entire drive time to try and complete my order on the app ‚Äî the store is obviously open, but still no pickup times are available.  When I questioned one manager about the app, he said, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt even know we had an app‚Äù ‚Äî I guess corporate needs to work on pushing out information to their stores and franchisees.  Another frustration is that when you try to choose a pick up time, you have to choose an option in 15 minute increments.  So, usually, I will be 5 minutes late or 10 minutes early to a location.  Then, it seems that they don‚Äôt make the food until you get there and talk to someone, so what is the point of ordering ahead?  I also don‚Äôt like that you have to choose your pickup method before you get to the store. So, if I choose drive-thru and then arrive at the store and there are 15 cars in the drive-thru line, I am stuck. So far, only the McDonald‚Äôs app lets you choose when you get to the store.  Overall, the Taco Bell app has been a frustrating experience ‚Äî and that is only for the 2 times I have gotten it to work.  For the other 5 times where I couldn‚Äôt even place my order it was worse."
"Husband just went to pick up our order and they don't have tomatoes, sour cream, red sauce, avocado sauce, or the ""double chalupa"" which was ""new featured item"" or the box (combo) in association with it so basically he asked for a regular chalupa instead of double; they couldn't substitute and couldn't refund b cause they didn't have the detailed order of the cost (extra cheese, ect) so once I called him and asked why she couldn't just pull up the order number and see the details... basically she eventually figured out how to refund (I think/hope) but I keep trying to give it another shot and because of the inconsistency and inconvenience I won't be attempting again. Sad part is I still love the app but my store never knows that I've placed an order and ALWAYS has issues like they are regularly out of things (beef?!) that are on the menu and once The app allows me to order off lunch menu my store still won't make it until 11:00 even though the app says lunch is available before then.... so basically a good app doesn't mean much if the stores aren't in sync with the app. 
(Previous review from 2 years ago..... I love that I get to take my time and order without feeling rushed and it's ready when I arrive!!)"
"So last night was the first time I downloaded and used the Taco Bell app instead of ordering inside/drive thru. The lady at the window was very nice and when she handed us the bag it was sealed shut, plus there was a long line and I was just ready to get home to eat and go to bed, so we didn‚Äôt bother checking. We‚Äôve never had issues with wrong orders before so checking the order didn‚Äôt cross our minds. Unfortunately when we got home and pulled all of the food out we were missing two desserts and all of our sauces we asked for. I checked the receipt to see if I made a mistake when I placed the order online since it‚Äôd been my first time using the app, and everything was correct on the receipt. We didn‚Äôt want to make the drive back to the store and wait in line again, so we just took the loss. Even better, when we finally started eating, I figured out the steak quesarito wasn‚Äôt even made right with the ingredients that was listed on the app. I was hungry so I ate it anyways.. with no sauce. I‚Äôm not saying I won‚Äôt go back, it‚Äôs just that Taco Bell has never disappointed this Taco Belle before. I‚Äôm not sure if the items were overlooked or if there is something confusing that just happens with the online/APP orders or what. I just thought I should leave this here. *Happy New Year*"
"I want to start out by saying I do love this app. I have food allergies and it helps the store get the order correct more often than not, and I love paying through the app. That being said, there are so many bugs in the app. If you add custom items (all my items require being custom to avoid my allergy) then add a meal, it wipes out all of your custom order. And you can‚Äôt go in and fix the order in the cart, it won‚Äôt let you save. You have to go in and delete each custom item and then add them back again. It‚Äôs best to add everything to the cart first then do customizations, but this has been a bug for a long time and should have already been resolved. Also, I created custom favorited items to help easily put in an allergy friendly order but the same or similar bug happens: it says it‚Äôs customized under favorites but when added to the cart, all changes are erased. Big problem for picky eaters and people with food allergies who may not know that happens. My paranoia at having a reaction making me triple check is the only reason I‚Äôve caught the app wiping my changes. It makes what should be a simple experience more complex and frustrating. Fix these bugs and this app is easily 5 stars."
"Taco Bell app is okay. It lags a lot of times no matter what location or state I‚Äôm in. 
Something I really don‚Äôt like about the Taco Bell app is that it doesn‚Äôt have the Limited menu items on their app for example ‚ÄúNacho Fries.‚Äù It‚Äôs not even located in the ‚ÄúNew‚Äù category which if it‚Äôs not a regular menu item it should be in there at least. Also another thing I don‚Äôt like about Taco Bell is that if you order in person or in drive-thru there‚Äôs no way to upload your missed transactions for Taco Bell rewards you‚Äôre only rewarded points for ordering in the Taco Bell app. Which I have no problem ordering through the app I prefer it however if you don‚Äôt have what people want to eat on the app like the ‚ÄúNacho Fries,‚Äù there‚Äôs no point ordering through the app. It would be a lot better if Taco Bell found a way where you could upload your receipt on their app for missed reward points just the same as Chick-fil-A does. Last week I visited Taco Bell drive-thru 4 times bc my family really enjoys Nacho Fries and that‚Äôs 4 visits of missed Taco Bell rewards point opportunities."
This app is constantly freezing and I constantly have to restart my app only to have to redo my entire order. I called customer service today to address this issues and was told they have been receiving calls all day. I‚Äôm not sure why Taco Bell doesn‚Äôt work on these issues that have been occurring for months now. It is very frustrating & it has deterred me from order from Taco Bell for months now. Then to make it even better when you use the app to order it always seems the stores flip out if you have a ‚Äúbig order‚Äù and they make you feel bad about it and you have to pull around and wait. You can hear the employees yelling and complaining and it‚Äôs a very uncomfortable experience. Something needs to be done within the app constantly crashing and the way customers are being treated for just simply placing orders on the app. I shouldn‚Äôt have to feel bad for placing a larger order for everyone in my family an modifying some of the toppings and they still not make it properly and I have to drive back. I have worked in the restaurant industry for years and it is part of your job to make & process orders correctly and not huff and puff just because someone placed a large order. I am unfortunately no longer going to take my business to Taco Bell because I feel as if my business and time is not valued by this company or location.
"i ordered online, pull up to the drivethru and they tell me that it hasn‚Äôt come through yet but not to worry that it would probably come through before we got up. I get up to the window and specify again that I am picking up for Lexi. They hand me food and thankfully i checked the bag, it wasn‚Äôt my food. I go inside and they have everyone ordering from the kiosks so that they can handle the drive thru, i think this is smart except that it took me raising my voice into the back of house for them to acknowledge me. I tell them that they handed me the wrong food and tell them my name once again, showing them my receipt. One of the nicer ladies took my phone into the BOH to show them what I ordered. There were a few other unhappy people in the lobby including one grubhub order that the drink made for the order was about half full and the driver was upset because that isn‚Äôt what he wants to deliver. another lady had used up 45 minutes of her hour long lunch dealing with this taco bell. They handed me the wrong food once more, before finally finishing my order 50 minutes later. Will not be returning, and sad to say i will not be using the app. I liked the app process because of the extra vegetarian options that are exclusively online, but it seems that the employees cannot handle the extra technology and queue."
"Wish I could give it 0 stars! I used to love this app when it first came out, especially when it had all the great offers. On July 8th though I used this app to place an almost $32 order and when my husband arrived to pick up the food on his way home from work, the cashier at the store told him there was no record of his order. I figured no problem, it was placed recently he'll just show the receipt in the app or the email receipt we received and they'll make the food, right? Wrong! They refused to give us any food and said we would need to pay again. The manager was not apologetic at all and said the charge would drop off in a few days automatically. Fast forward through 2 emails to customer service, 1 phone call to customer service, and finally filing a dispute with my credit card company. I finally received an email from customer service yesterday saying they are refunding the money, but to wait 3-4 days for it to process. The worst part in all of this communication we have received 0 apologies from Taco Bell and obviously 0 food. 13 days later and I am still waiting for them to fully process our money back. I have never been so disappointed in a company's response & definitely do not recommend using this app to place an order if you value your hard earned money."
"This was a great app!  I was using it quite frequently, until it suddenly stopped working. There were a few glitches here & there (it wouldn‚Äôt find restaurants in the area, although I had ordered in the same place before, and wouldn‚Äôt let me sign in), but after a day or two, it started working again. I was hoping the glitches would get fixed, so it would be more reliable. However, it suddenly stopped working completely - won‚Äôt let me log in, won‚Äôt let me reset my password, I‚Äôm totally locked out. I can‚Äôt find anywhere online to get help either. If this issue can be fixed, I would say it‚Äôs a great app, but until then, it‚Äôs useless.

Update, 9/7/19
I want to love this app, but it just won‚Äôt work right. Previous problems were finally fixed, and now, for the last couple of months, the app will not let me check out to pay & finish the order. I deleted the app today & reloaded it to my iPhone XR, and it looks like it lets me pay, but then ultimately, it gives me an error, and the store doesn‚Äôt get the order. Very frustrating. 
I wish the app would get fixed!!!"
"I‚Äôve had no issues with the app until the past couple of weeks. I pulled up, placed my order, and noticed that the app started acting glitchy. It froze and then took me back to the menu. Hmm.. so I looked at my email to see no confirmation, but when I looked at my bank account it took out the money so I walked inside and told them what happened. The manager came up and told me they didn‚Äôt get my order so I showed him my bank transaction. To prove I bought it and they made it for me. You could tell he was just as frustrated as I was. Yesterday I was at a different location, I pull up change and confirmed the new address and places the order. I walk in.. the employees didn‚Äôt get my order! I was like what?? So I look at it and it sent it to another Taco Bell ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è and it‚Äôs like not even close to where I was. Neither stores can do anything there about it. Luckily there is a number for Taco Bell that they gave me and they were super nice, so I‚Äôm waiting on my money but man what an inconvenience. Still love Taco Bell though! Will probably skip the app for a little while lol"
"Absolutely terrible experience with this... I‚Äôm assuming that the store to app interface is still glitchy and needs be worked with more. Everything was fine when working the app myself but when it came time to pick up my food that‚Äôs when the issues occurred. I drove through the drive thru and gave the employees my name and that I ordered from the TacoBell app they then acknowledged it and I proceeded to drive up to the window. While waiting in line I tracked my orders progress by using this app which had stated my order was being prepared and then was ready, thinking that my order would be waiting on me at the window. Much to my surprise it wasn‚Äôt I then gave the employee at the window my name and they seemed dumbfounded. They then ask a manager who tried to figure it out my order who stating that I had placed the order to pick up in the store(I don‚Äôt know why that would slow production down though just put it in a bag) when I had this app open which clearly stated drive thru. Then I continued to hold up the drive thru line longer than if I would have just ordered while I was there. This app obviously still has some issues and bugs to work out when it comes to communication in stores and what the employees are seeing on their side. My opinion just continue to order as you get there until this app gets fixed."
"This app is now a pleasure to use and really works well!  Five Stars - well done developers!  My previous review follows:  They did fix the issues that I complained about! Bravo! The app works much better. I can order food, customize and check out! The app is easier to use and now has rewards. The app is still a little glitchy, and says ‚Äúsomething went wrong on our end‚Äù too much. Fix that and my review would be 5 stars. My old review follows: I used to love this app. I can easily find the nearest Taco Bell, see what's on the menu, see calories, and customize my meal. But every time that I try to submit my order and check out, it says that there is a problem with my payment source. I get the same message regardless of which payment source I use, and there is actually nothing wrong with any of them. The point of a mobile app is to be able to order food, and this one won't let me do that. Please fix this."
"Alright, let me start by saying I enjoy a Crunchwrap and Gordita crunch as much as the next hungry idiot who wants cheap food.
However, this app and TBell as a company has gone to complete crap. I had ALL notifications turned OFF inside the app and it still shoves pop advertisements on my phone homescreen from out of nowhere. Boooo. 
Now for the real reason your quality has plummeted: the food and service is terrible. The time estimate and ‚Äúyour food is ready for pickup‚Äù is ALWAYS wrong. I end up waiting and extra 10-15 minutes after the app says the food is ready and sometimes I have to ask if they have even started making my order. Four different locations in the CA Bay Area have all gotten my food order wrong about 95% of the time we order anything. Even as simple as not including the correct items, or forgetting items entirely. It happens so often that I‚Äôm not surprised in the least when I have to go back to the counter and ask ‚Äúhey where‚Äôs my taco AND burrito???‚Äù 
It‚Äôs not like these are complicated orders, only 5-6 items total. And I get it, it‚Äôs cheap fast food and I shouldn‚Äôt expect much. But come on, my new expectation is that Taco Bell will mess up from the start, waste time, and I‚Äôll leave disappointed again. 
But you guys don‚Äôt really care, that much is obvious."
"On a perfect day I pull up the app, select a free reward... and order the rest of my food how I want it. I place the order and just show up and say my name. All well and good. Except sometimes the app doesn‚Äôt like me logging in, sometimes it doesn‚Äôt want me to make certain customizations to my order, and sometimes it doesn‚Äôt want me to order at all. I used to be able to make a bean burrito ‚Äúgrilled‚Äù and now the option isn‚Äôt there at all, despite it still being an option for similar burritos. I can ask at the window and they can still grill it... the app just doesn‚Äôt show the option anymore. My BIGGEST complaint is sometimes the app will tell me a store isn‚Äôt available for an order. This is usually at night within a few hours of their closing, but they‚Äôre still 100% open and taking orders. I ask them and they don‚Äôt know why the app isn‚Äôt letting people order from their location. Things like this while minor and inconsistent do cause frustration and take away from the experience. Also I can‚Äôt seem to be able to log in to my profile about half the times I open the app."
I placed my order last night at 8:50 I got to TB at about 9ish had to wait in the line for about 20+ mins to check in. When I checked in they asked my name and said they located my order via app and are now preparing it. By the time I got to the line the lady was so rude. She had her mask on one ear hanging off her head. And was basically wanting me to take my mask if so she could hear he better which makes no sense. She left the window shortly and came back to tell me they didn‚Äôt have any more containers for what I ordered so they can make my order. I said it‚Äôs fine I don‚Äôt mind using small cups or whatever you can use they literally were just lazy and rude and it wouldn‚Äôt make my food that I already paid for via the app. They never emailed me this was an issue so I could avoid even showing up. Let‚Äôs say they ran out of containers while I was in line when I checked in they say my order and could have told me then but they didn‚Äôt. So I didn‚Äôt get to feed my kids last night because I couldn‚Äôt even get my refund to go elsewhere and buy food. The woman‚Äôs name was laKendra and the manager whom I‚Äôm wouldn‚Äôt tell me his name wasn‚Äôt wearing name tags no one was. Worst experience ever I‚Äôll never use this app again and never support Taco Bell again!!
"Very easy ordering and modifying the order. The big problem his employees not paying attention. Last time I ordered from 60 Vandenburgh Avenue In Troy New York. I ordered a burrito with no guacamole and instead they put so much in the Burrito it was oozing out of both ends. Which I didn‚Äôt find out until I was back home. And this was not the only time stuff like this happened. We‚Äôre given the option to change the product we‚Äôre purchasing. Like myself ,I don‚Äôt like the refried beans or the sour cream. So I usually remove them and add black beans and guacamole. But then when I pick it up and get home and look at the product it ends up having sour cream and refried beans after I paid extra for add-ons that I wanted.  and I know it‚Äôs not all the stores and I know it‚Äôs not all the employees. Maybe somehow on the screen that the employee is looking at if anything is removed or anything added would be lit up in different colors. Maybe it‚Äôs already that way I don‚Äôt know. But when you‚Äôre the only customer at the store and they mess up the orders. It gets old pretty quick"
"I‚Äôm giving it 5 stars because I‚Äôm not one of those people who needs the world to burn when something doesn‚Äôt work, but there‚Äôs a glitch in the new rewards system that I hope someone sees. When you select a reward, you also have to add it to your order. That‚Äôs fine but, should you mistype or something, you can‚Äôt remove the reward. The problem is that the app‚Äôs built-in ‚Äúdon‚Äôt forget your reward‚Äù tool won‚Äôt let you complete the order unless you select that item. I checked the reward, didn‚Äôt want it and couldn‚Äôt delete it. Restarted the app, redid the order and it couldn‚Äôt be submitted/paid for because that error keeps coming up. 

I eventually just took the reward. I did that three days ago and now, on a separate order that I didn‚Äôt even look at rewards for, I‚Äôm still getting the ‚Äúdon‚Äôt waste your reward‚Äù error. Because of how it‚Äôs built, I press ‚ÄúOK‚Äù and it grays-out the payment option, so I now can‚Äôt submit any more orders until this is fixed."
"I have tried several times to use this app to order food, and I always have a problem. I could literally go to the grocery store, buy everything I need to make tacos, and come home and cook it faster than I can order using the app. The app is constantly glitching and freezing. I have to get off the app, close it out on my phone, and go back in for every step in the ordering process! When you are placing orders for 4-5 people this takes forever. Even ordering for one person takes forever. And good luck using the special offers! It doesn‚Äôt even work most of the time. The special offers are usually why I decided to order from Taco Bell in the first place. I tried ordering the free taco today and was never able to because I kept getting error messages. It would also not register what I was trying to order, so I would press the button of whatever I wanted to order several times. When it finally registered, I had like 7 tacos in my cart. I don‚Äôt understand how this app has such a high rating. I see more one-star ratings than anything else. And most people have the same issues that I do. Please work on fixing your app, Taco Bell. I have several other food apps on my phone, and this is the only one I have issues like this with."
"I love the idea of the rewards system but the app as a whole definitely has some glitches. To start off, every time we order through the app we have used the drive-thru pick up option and both times the employees did not start working on our order until we arrived at the pick up window. They said the order was not appearing on the screen that they look to for orders. I think there needs to be some attention given to the importance of online orders because they seem to be an afterthought. We waited so long in the line because of the online orders taking up so much time and clogging up Drive they process. It needs to be streamlined because ever since it‚Äôs been introduced it‚Äôs slowed down the drivethru process immensely. 

The next issue was that when I went to redeem my first reward (Doritos locos Taco) it just kept not working. No matter how many times I added it to my cart using the redeem button it just wouldn‚Äôt register the discount. Now I had to order a taco that I did not want to pay for. 

I hope these glitches can be figured out soon because these are major reasons to stop using the app altogether."
I and my family decided to order our food using taco bell app. we spent good amount of time to select food. when it came to payment step . i added my card and it said use another payment method. which is weird. i tried my second card same thing. then third card same thing . third card transaction go through but app got hang on payment page saying use another payment method then i tried my debit card same thing. i got so mad and call customer service and that lady told me r u using chase card. I said nope. she said let me take a look. this whole process took close to an hour. then she told me that there is system wide issue. so I am sorry that is what her response. anyways I would say hire smart tech people. so business does not get impact on revenue side.  Finally I ended up going store and that store also mess. quality and quantity was not there. CTO need to be replaced. This is my worse day working with such a stupid app.
"I was forced to upgrade today, which seems to happen every time I try to use it. That is aggravating because it forgets my credentials and I have to authenticate again. This time that did not happen though. Now the app either flashes open and closes, or opens to a window that just says something like ‚Äúbrowse food menu‚Äù but that button does nothing, and there is nothing to click on. I even tried restarting my iPhone to ensure that was not causing the problem, but no change in behavior. I headed to Del Taco instead...

Update: So a new bug fix came out so I hoped that the issue would be fixed but no. First time opening, it opens and crashes.  Second time opens to the useless page with no working links on it as described above.  My iPhone is relatively new and on the latest version from Apple. Does anyone even test these releases to see if they are minimally functional?

This app is still updating seemingly constantly, and of course , is set so you can‚Äôt use any prior version. Ordered two days ago, go to order today, nope - need to update again.  I‚Äôm sick of constantly updating this app and may just delete instead. You can use the website to order so why deal with this nonsense?"
"I have been using the app for a while now and never had any real issues until I went to place an order tonight. I went to add a taco party pack to my cart but wanted to change it from mixed (crunchy and soft) to just soft..no problem there, but I also wanted to remove the lettuce from my order, but there was no option to do so this time! I went to past orders and saw where I had done this in the past. I tried to just add my past order to my cart and it was all added but wasn‚Äôt added how I had ordered them in the past with no lettuce, it just put a taco party pack in my cart with no modifications. My daughters were waiting (impatiently) for me to place the order so they could leave and pick it up so I just went ahead and ordered the tacos with the lettuce on them. Once they got back to the house with the order I spent forever having to pick a half head of lettuce off of each taco. üôÑü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è If we can‚Äôt modify or customize our order at least chill with the lettuce! 1/8 of a cup of meat, 3 sprinkles of cheese, and half a head of lettuce‚Ä¶come on üôÑüôÑ"
"Overall, I LOVE the Taco Bell app. I much prefer ordering on the app than I do at the drive thru. I love the easy customization options and that you can save your favorites.

The issues I have - it is constantly logging me out. I‚Äôm someone who never can keep track of passwords, so being logged out all the time is frustrating. Also, when you get an error during checkout because an item is sold out, or no longer being sold at that particular location, it doesn‚Äôt tell you what the issue is. So, you click ‚Äúcheck out‚Äù and have a gigantic order for multiple people ready to go‚Ä¶and there‚Äôs an error. You can‚Äôt narrow it down to what item is causing the issue. In those cases I just order at the drive thru so they can tell me what‚Äôs missing, but then I lose out on the rewards points. They have added a ‚Äúreceipt scan‚Äù feature, but it‚Äôs not available for all locations yet. 

I have also had issues redeeming rewards, and it expires before it ever works. Frustrating as well!"
"If you love Taco Bell the you probably won‚Äôt care what I have to say. But if you don‚Äôt love Taco Bell let me say something quick about the app. You can‚Äôt cancel the order. This created a problem for me when I realized I placed it at the wrong location. The app was of no help nor does it allow you to reach anyone. I called the store I placed the order at and they were of no help and lied about refunding my order which was approximately $33 for a mini group. I looked on the Taco Bell website and there wasn‚Äôt a number to speak to anyone. I sent an email and found a corporate number on the internet and no one ever returned my communication. This app is not worth it.

But if you love Taco Bell just go in or drive through. I‚Äôll take this opportunity to give my own personal thought. Taco Bell is cheap so I get it. Sometimes times are tough and you have to eat what you can afford. But the quality of food is horrible. Obviously some people are going to love it so I‚Äôm not talking to you. But for the rest of you thinking of getting this app or visiting Taco Bell I ask you again, do you really want Taco Bell? My answer is not only no, but never again. There‚Äôs definitely something better waiting for you."
"I used this app once and it was awesome. The next time I used it, I submitted my order and picked my normal location that I go to. It showed that they received my order, when I showed up they claimed that they never received the order and that I had to wait for them to receive the order. I waited 5 minutes and checked again because I didn‚Äôt want to just order it again and get charged twice in my credit card. After 10
minuted they still didn‚Äôt receive my order and I decided to just cancel the order. I showed the workers my phone so that they new it was the right location and even the order number and they couldn‚Äôt figure out why it wasn‚Äôt showing up on their end. I guess the app is made by a 3 party company and had some flaws in their programming. Just don‚Äôt waste your time on the app and order the normal way so you don‚Äôt end up mad like me."
"My account was made using my Facebook account. The app has since logged me out and when I try to Log In With Facebook, I get an error message. I also can‚Äôt make a new account because itms already using that email address. As far as I can tell there is no service email or number to call. There is only an FAQ that does not cover this. Also why is it when you tap the Sign Up/ Log in button, it goes to a sign up page by default and you need to tap another link to log in? It should be the other way around. You only need to sign up once, but may have to log in multiple times. That‚Äôs just a bad UI choice. Also whenever I have made an order through the app, the food is never ready on time. They usually don‚Äôt even get my order until after I have shown up. Overall this app is poorly made and not worth the time or effort

Update: it‚Äôs been months and even after an update stating Facebook login issues were resolved, I still get an error saying ‚ÄúLog in failed. Please try again.‚Äù after pressing the Log in with Facebook button. I sent an email to their support but never got a response either. This app is just not worth anyone‚Äôs time. Will be deleting unless something changes soon."
"Idk if its just me, but i been trying to give the app a few chances, on account of the rewards they have. Yet i dont find it worth it in the slightest due in part to the fact the app has, undoubtedly everytime, messed up one or more items on my order.
The process is on infuriating because i am aware of it happening before that i try to stop it by checking the summary and everything of my order before i order. For example i love to customie items on the app and after i do and submit they will have no customized options added into it. Also when choosing the cravings box i would pick my favorite items and this last order which sadly made me write this review and decide to no longer use the app and just go inside. This moment it gave me all 3 completely different options and took away my customized large drink and it didnt say anything until after i paid and the order was placed then the item like reverted back to the original or idk but it‚Äôs annoying and i really hope nobody else has this struggle
I mean whats the point of customizing if i cant get extra queso! I get if the employee is negligent but the app doing me dirty hurts like adulting :("
"I‚Äôve had this app since the beginning and when it works it‚Äôs great but it rarely ever works and I am done waiting for them to figure it out. It crashes all the time or empties my cart randomly while I‚Äôm working on my order. It takes forever to load screens and often crashes on the payment step. Half the time whatever I‚Äôm adding to my cart it tells me I can‚Äôt, it literally says access denied. Sometimes I can try something different and get it to add but then it automatically deletes itself from my cart saying it‚Äôs not available at my store right now which would be annoying, but more acceptable, except when I finally give up on the app and just go to the drive through like normal they suddenly have whatever it was I was trying to order on the app in stock so I‚Äôm really not sure why it doesn‚Äôt work on the app. It constantly logs me out and keeps telling me my log in info isn‚Äôt right when I know it is and right when I‚Äôm about to give up it just works. It never saves my favorites so I have to re-put them in every time in hopes they‚Äôve figured out how to stop deleting it. Honestly I‚Äôm not sure why I‚Äôve given it so many chances over the year but it‚Äôs ridiculous that it still doesn‚Äôt work."
"I use this app a couple times a week at least, have been for a couple years, the app is a constant nightmare. It will consistently go down for a day at a time, saying ‚Äúthere are no time slots available for this restaurant. Please choose another location‚Äù and then it says it again for every location you try. The rewards just flat out don‚Äôt work anymore, I should have a year‚Äôs supply of food rewards by now, and it won‚Äôt let you access your points. The App acts like it‚Äôs loading your points, then it just stops and it just says ‚Äú0‚Äù at all times. Even when they make sure to tell you every time you order how many points you‚Äôve earned. Periodically, the app will just sign you out and lose your saved items until you sign back in, and the ‚Äúmy orders‚Äù function just doesn‚Äôt work at any time.

I‚Äôve seen a couple bad reviews such as mine that somehow are still showing a 5* rating, so I‚Äôd like to also state here for all to see, THIS IS A 1* RATING

Please fix the app, Taco Bell. Spend money fixing these bugs before you spend money printing any more signs for your windows asking customers to ‚ÄúSKIP THE LINE, ORDER AHEAD ON THE APP‚Äù"
"I downloaded this app and placed an order as a guest user. I chose the Apple Pay option and was immediately charged. Right after I placed the order, I was greeted with a screen giving me the option to track my order or continue with registering an account. I decided to go ahead and register for an account. Go back into my orders and it‚Äôs gone! So I go to Taco Bell and they have no record of my order and told me I have to ‚Äúcheck in‚Äù on the app. Well I can‚Äôt really do that if my order has just vanished. I also got no confirmation email at all. What was the point of having to enter my email address (prior to creating the account) and charging me right then and there if I was going to get no receipt whatsoever? And no option to contact them in-app should something go wrong. Just some ‚Äúdon‚Äôt call us, we‚Äôll call you‚Äù form you have to find online and a phone number I found after further internet searching that you sit on hold for over 30 minutes before getting frustrated and hanging up. So now I‚Äôm out $22 AND I have to go home and tell the family I didn‚Äôt get dinner because I‚Äôll be damned if I pay 2x for the same meal. Shame on you, Taco Bell."
"This used to be one of my favorite fast food apps. 
In fact, next to Chick-Fil-A, it used to sit on the throne of what I considered to be one of the very best food apps on the App Store.
I don‚Äôt know what happened, but it seems to be less and less stable with every update.
Most infuriating, the favorites section that should allow you to save items with customizations will only sometimes remember those customizations. More often then not, you‚Äôll add an item to your order from the favorites menu and have to go through the whole customization process all over again to make the item how you want it.
Then, if you manage to get the app to open and load the menu (which is very difficult and usually takes several tries even on a gigabit-class internet connection), get your items in the cart, customize them how many ever times it takes to get the options to stick, and get to the checkout, you‚Äôll be lucky to be able to select whether you‚Äôre eating in or going through the drive thru. 
Oh, and heaven help you if you need to order your food for a little later because it causes the whole checkout screen to refresh if you select any other time then right now. At some point you might be able to reselect your Dine In or Drive Thru option and check out, but at this point I‚Äôm sometimes so frustrated I just don‚Äôt bother. 

At least the app has Apple Pay. They still have that right."
"Update: upped star rating from 1 to 2 because tech support WAS working with me to get the app to allow me to login. As of now, the app still will not allow me to login and I‚Äôve not hear from tech support for weeks.
In the last month I‚Äôve tried to order through the app 3 times. Each time I was soooo mad after sitting in the parking lot trying to get my password to reset (I‚Äôve even tried to reset it before I go there) that I left in a huff! I‚Äôve even tried to order through their website over the last year, it worked approximately 10% of the time. I think it‚Äôs been a year since I actually bought anything from Taco Bell. Don‚Äôt get me wrong. I love Taco Bell, but it pisses me off when I can order my husband‚Äôs fast food ‚Äúcurbside‚Äù at McDonald‚Äôs in less than 5 minutes (and it works every time) and Taco Bell‚Äôs app does work. That means I have to have McDonald‚Äôs food! Please fix the app for everyone."
"The app has is issues like other apps. Like the other day it didn‚Äôt put my order threw then told me I had to change my password and then would not let me log in. Items not adding. And then sometimes there‚Äôs suddenly like 10 of that item added on. Or it keeping your last order in the cart even tho you already ordered, so now you have to manually remove everything and if your not paying attention you will end up ordering it all again. Glitches saying that item isn‚Äôt available when it is. I‚Äôm hoping this most recent update has fixed all that. But they have not fixed the issue of being able to order root beer. Before this update you could at lest click the option fountain drink. And then tell them when you get there. But now you have to pick the drink. Even tho Taco Bell sales root beer it will not let you pick it. Some time it will only allow you to pick between a few select drinks like just Pepsi and mtn dew. That‚Äôs the biggest thing that bothers me about the app."
"I‚Äôve made quite a few orders on the app and I can say that it‚Äôs been really easy to navigate the menu and make my orders. It‚Äôs nice that I can schedule a time to get my food too. I only have one gripe, though, and it‚Äôs kinda major. It‚Äôs paying for the food.

For some reason, for every order I‚Äôve done, I‚Äôve tried paying with my debit card but the app won‚Äôt let the payment go through. I triple-checked my card info and it was all correct, so I don‚Äôt know why I couldn‚Äôt pay. When I tried my credit card, it went through first time. Why does only that one work? I just don‚Äôt get it. And I‚Äôd much rather pay with my own money rather than with credit. I know I could just pay with debit card at the store, but that just defeats the purpose of the app in getting points and rewards, and I‚Äôd really like to get rewarded for my orders. I hope this issue can be fixed soon, but other than that, the app is great. I recommend it."
"I tried using the Taco Bell app last night. I definitely won‚Äôt be doing that again. Although it may have been user error, I could‚Äôve sworn I selected the correct Taco Bell location. Once I got to the store I realized this was not true. I asked the person at the counter if there was any way that I could switch my order to this Taco Bell, and she told me there is no way to reimburse me and she‚Äôd have to charge me again for the same order. I had ordered a few party packs of tacos so I really didn‚Äôt want to spend that money twice. I had to go 15 minutes out of my way to the correct Taco Bell. Once I was there, I figured they would at least have my tacos ready, but that was not the case either. I ended up having to wait for 25 minutes for the tacos to be ready and there were only 3 other customers in that location. They gave me a coupon for one free taco for my inconvenience. When I got home over half of the tacos had no lettuce in them. Many of them had clearly been carelessly smashed. I just don‚Äôt think this app (or Taco Bell in general) lived up to my expectation. I feel that it made the process more difficult. I will not be using this app again."
"The app works great. I like being able to customize my order. I always just hit the button saying ""I am at the store"" about 3-4 minutes before I pull up to the store and it is ""usually"" ready within a few minutes after I actually arrive. The downside is that I have not been using it much anymore. There used to be ""offers"" available every time u used the app. Sometimes it was 10% off your whole order or maybe a free item or upgrade. There hasn't been an offer on the app in what I would guesstimate to be about a year. When offers were available I used to stop by the one near my workplace all the time. Now there is a Taco Bueno and a Taco Casa not far from the Bell. I opt to stop at those 2 places much more frequently now, when in the past I almost never did. Maybe someday Bell will wake up and start providing ""offers"" again and then I'll go back to my routine of grabbing a bite there. Until then my very routine business will often go to other local businesses since I'm not saving anything with Bell over them."
"Downloaded app to place an order for 20 or so items, to save time ordering at restaurant. Took like 15 minutes to place the order and I click button to order.  App gives me an error stating the payment method wasn‚Äôt valid.  I thought something must be wrong so I submitted again, still same error.  Then I decided to try another payment method, received same error yet again.  While my husband called the store, I look up my credit cards and 3 SEPARATE HOLDS for the same amount on my cards!!! The store says the order never came through.  WHAT A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME!  Supposedly since the store didn‚Äôt create the order, my pending statement charges would be dropped, per the store.
Then I decided to go in store to order at the kiosk rather than take up time in the drive thru. That took another 15 minutes of my time attempting to duplicate my online order. On top of that, of course there‚Äôs a special box you can only order online, not available in store.  Then had to wait another 10-15 min for my large order to be made.  Again, A COMPLETE WASTE OF MY TIME AND COMPLETE INCONVENIENCE for the card holds.  Never using app again, don‚Äôt trust it!"
"I used to eat at Taco Bell and use the Taco Bell app weekly. However, it just takes too much energy to keep up with their apps issues. I won‚Äôt fight to eat at or use their app again. Today I experienced my 3rd time of not being able to get in the app because my password doesn‚Äôt match. The 1st time I just reset my password. The 2nd time I changed my password and wrote it down  (although I have an iphone 11 which automatically stores your passwords)  and today I can not change the password or resign up. The link to ‚Äúforgot my password‚Äù doesn‚Äôt work and it tells me my email is already in use. Could I resign up with an alternate email? Sure! But why? And why give my hard earned cash to a company that doesn‚Äôt hire reliable developers? I live in a beach town in Florida. There are literally so many fast food, casual dining and carry out places within 2 miles of my house I could eat at a different one every day for a month. For anyone having the same problem AND lives near a Chipotle.... Use the Chipotle app and eat there! The food is better, the restaurants are cleaner, they have more experienced help AND THEIR APP ROCKS!"
"I think it‚Äôs the dumbest thing in the world to have an app where you can order your food ahead of time, or at least select your food ahead a time, but yet you still have to go to the restaurant and wait. I‚Äôve never heard of such a thing‚Ä¶ Thank God pizza places don‚Äôt make you do this. McDonald‚Äôs kind of does this too, but at least their App like recognizes when you‚Äôre at the store and they start making your food so if there‚Äôs a line through the drive-through you can still skip it. Taco Bell Avenue literally saved you no time at all‚Ä¶ And they used to have coupons and specials which made it pretty sweet but I‚Äôm pretty sure they don‚Äôt even have those anymore or at least I haven‚Äôt seen them in a long time. But with the Taco Bell app they literally don‚Äôt start making the food until you arrive and tell them at the drive-through that you‚Äôre there‚Ä¶ So it‚Äôs ‚Äúfresh ‚Äú...I appreciate the desire for freshness however I would rather it be made and ready for me by the time I arrive‚Ä¶ Sitting there for two or three minutes while I am driving to the restaurant doesn‚Äôt make it any less fresh"
"The app is horribly slow and unoptimized. The new update destroyed the app.

Take some time to give attention to detail before rushing out a new version. 
Literally takes 4 seconds for the app to process and load that one of the categories at the top was clicked now. 4 seconds for the bottom tabs as well. 2 seconds to swipe back and forth between the food menus.

Those categories at the top doesn‚Äôt support fluent-motion movement. Instead, they move in ‚Äúpages‚Äù but you can tell it was designed for fluid-motion. When you‚Äôre navigating the ‚Äúpages‚Äù, it‚Äôs cutting off half the name for ‚ÄúOnline Exclusives‚Äù, ‚ÄúBurritos‚Äù, ‚ÄúSpecialties‚Äù, ‚ÄúGroups‚Äù, and ‚ÄúNew Cravings Value Menu‚Äù.

You can‚Äôt swipe from the left side of the screen to go back. You can‚Äôt swipe right to open the right-side menus when they are there. (You can swipe items in the checkout, so that functionality is already used, just not integrated.)

The ‚Äúhome‚Äù tab at the bottom features outdated deals.

There‚Äôs a point and reward system, but you can‚Äôt look at the rewards until you unlock them or look under ‚Äúhow it works‚Äù. 

A positive note is that the ‚ÄúMy Info‚Äù tab is much more handy with the option to save payment type. However, I would suggest adding a note that Apple Pay is available during the checkout process. Adding and saving a card directly into a fast food app is just a big no nowadays."
"I‚Äôm always having issues where the app will change my order or ignore my chosen payment method. Example: selecting the medium drink because of happy hour and checking out only to find it at $2 because it changed it to large. And going to go reselect medium again a few more times and each time it would change it to large at checkout. Or doing customizations in the app and get the order and the paper receipt would show no such customizations. I paid for it so it needs to go from the app to the store. Then lastly, I am always fighting the app to use my gift cards. I would have the gift card selected, but it would run my card instead. There‚Äôs a positive balance on the GC but it just never wants to run the GC. It 60% of the time would just run my debit card on file instead. The app just has me spending more money than I have been wanting to spend. I‚Äôm starting to think that all these bugs are on purpose. Because it can‚Äôt just be a coincidence."
"It worked one time when I was driving around doing errands, ad I worked an picked up my food. After that one time, an for the last 5-10 times I've gone in the past 7 months, it has NOT worked. Most of the time, it was a glitch in the system, and the screen would freeze no matter how many times I turned off my phone, and then turned it back on. The last 2 or so times, the ordering process has been good, BUT when I try to submit my order, it does NOT accept my credit card. I try 3 cards, and the order will continue to have errors and say that I need to switch payments. All of my 3 cards ARE very much valid and functional, which mean that the tech nerds that created the Taco Bell app need to use their brain and no their stomach to make a functional app. I'm not that annoyed that the only way I can get food from Taco Bell is to go in person and order it at the kiosk, but its just frusturating. If you want food from taco Bell, place the order in person, or in the drive thru because taco Bell hasn't come up with a great functioning app yet. Just pretend that there is no taco Bell app and do it normally, in person. Wow..."
"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP - THEY ARE ACCIDENTALLY SHARING USER INFO INCLUDING CC#, EMAIL, AND LOCATION. See edit. 

Completely unusable now. I used the previous app version to order Taco Bell for myself and coworkers at least 2x a week. We never had any problems and I really enjoyed the ability to ‚Äúcheck in‚Äù when at the location so the food is prepared hot and fresh. I‚Äôm so sick of developers updating apps for the sake of it. You had a fully functional and aesthetically pleasing, easy to navigate product before. Now my order won‚Äôt even go through, navigation is a wreck, it‚Äôs not at all pleasing to the eye, and the one feature I valued is gone. Congrats, Taco Bell. You‚Äôve lost another customer.

Edit: I just checked the app again and I am logged into a strangers account? It says ‚ÄúWelcome Charlotte!‚Äù with their email address and everything. This is a serious breach in security. If I have their info, who has mine???? Taco Bell, this is a loss. I can send screenshots of this stranger‚Äôs information to any dev that would be willing to contact me and explain this. I will be personally emailing her to let her know that Taco Bell has given her private info to me and who knows who else."
"Would be a good app, much better way to order if it wasn‚Äôt for one bug that ruins it. One star because, even if the app is great otherwise, it doesn‚Äôt do much good if I can‚Äôt submit the order

So there is this glitch that has been there for a long time and I even stopped going to taco bell because I was so annoyed. When I check out it won‚Äôt let me pay. It just keeps resetting the ‚Äúhow will you pick this up?‚Äù question after you answer it and you can‚Äôt submit. It‚Äôs really a pain when you have got your order perfect and customized and then you can‚Äôt put it in. So you have to order it at the drive thru. And my taco bell gets orders screwed up all the time, with or without customization. But they never once got a mobile order wrong. So the thought of having to order there because the app is not working is a real downer, and at that point I just choose somewhere else. 

I ordered recently and it processed. But  now it‚Äôs doing the same thing to me again., after I put my order together I can‚Äôt submit it. And I‚Äôm so irritated I don‚Äôt want taco bell anymore. Maybe in a while when I feel like trying again they will fix it..."
"I just downloaded the app, it‚Äôs cool to be able to customize my tacos, really see what I get and change how I want it. But it gave me two coupons and won‚Äôt allow me to use either. It even showed that I could use the coupon, it expires in 14 days. The only 2 requirements were to order online or on the app, and that the max discount is $10. When I went to check out, the coupon was there but then it kept removing it, saying that I had items that are only available during happier hour. I had no items, because I clicked ‚Äúremove items‚Äù, nothing was taken off my cart. But the coupon was still on my cart, but it‚Äôs when I go to check out that it is removed from my cart. Idk what‚Äôs going on, but it made the whole night bad because I couldn‚Äôt get this great discount. I can always go and order in person, but a deal is a deal."
"When the app works, it‚Äôs good. Recently, when you select to reorder a previous order, it does not save any of the customizations when it previously did. When you make customizations, the app adds several copies of the meal to your bag. The most recent issue is all the locations nearby have been delisted from the app, however it shows an error of ‚Äúthis store is closing soon‚Äù despite the store not having any reduced hours and is open as normal. If the delisting is from supply issues the app should reflect that. Occasionally (about once a week sometimes multiple time a week) the app will lock you out completely. It will show ‚Äúthe app is busy‚Äù and a 5 minute timer starts. This usually lasts 1+ hours. This app has also double charged me and customer support is not helpful asking me for information that is all on file through the app. This app has taken a significant downturn from the update a few months ago. They should roll back the update until they figure it out. Usually companies can iron out issues like this pretty quick but it seems to keep getting worse."
"I got the app because my cell carrier gave free tacos through the app. 

While the concept was good, it takes so long to load that it makes it annoying. When trying to customize an order, I‚Äôd rather see the words than the pictures if it means the app won‚Äôt crash. It shouldn‚Äôt take 15 minutes to place an order for a #8 combo with no lettuce. You have to individually click on the item you want changed for each item in the combo- which I understand the logic for, but it increases the likelihood that the app will crash each time.

Then once you finally get it placed, the restaurants don‚Äôt seem to know what to do. Many problematic experiences at every location we tried.

Also, when trying to save a customized order for a combo, it will say customized - but those edits disappear from the instructions to the restaurant it‚Äôs being sent. This mistake can only be seen when I click on the item to review it at checkout. That pretty much makes the ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù function useless. Not to mention that those ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù items disappear randomly from my account from one week to the next.

If you like all the menu items exactly the way they are normally made, then this app shouldn‚Äôt be too bad. But if you want extra sauce, or no sour cream,..., you need to have patience.

FOLLOW UP:
The app worked perfectly for the first time, even the ‚Äúfavorites‚Äù feature! I‚Äôm impressed by how quickly these issues were fixed. Thanks."
"This app doesn‚Äôt function particularly well and the main reason is that it can fail to process your order. I tried to place an order that was roughly $42 and when it came time to check out, I added my debit card and the checkout failed. The order was never placed and I kept getting an error message that said ‚Äúyour payment can not be processed at this time‚Äù. We tried with different debit cards but none of our payment methods worked. When we decided to give up and just drive to Taco Bell to make the order, I check my bank account and the app charged me 5 times. I was charged over $200 for an order that wasn‚Äôt received or made and when I contacted Taco Bell customer support, they gave me the runaround and told me I have to wait three business days before the correction shows in the system with no guarantee that it would. So basically, if you download this app, BE WARNED! It can and will take your money and you will be without that money for days. I‚Äôm severely disappointed that I did literally everything right and I have to front the bill for nothing. That‚Äôs what Taco Bell thinks of their customers. I am not worth their time."
"I got this app when the build your own Box deal came around because it‚Äôs only available on the app. no big deal right? I tried 30 times to order this box one day. I would customize and hit ‚Äúadd to cart‚Äù. When i went to my cart it keeps saying ‚Äúready to get started whenever you are‚Äù and says i haven‚Äôt added anything to my cart? So i tried to create an account thinking ‚Äúmaybe it only works if you have an account‚Äù. well the app won‚Äôt let me make an account either. After I fill in all my info it keeps saying ‚Äúplease fix all highlighted areas above‚Äù, BUT THERE ARE NO HIGHLIGHTED AREAS. So i try to make an account with my Facebook. When i type in my email it says that it‚Äôs not in the correct format even though it definitely is! I‚Äôm a bit tired with the app and all of its problems. I‚Äôm a vegetarian and there is never a box that I can have. So the only way for me to save money and get a box is through the app that won‚Äôt work for me! I also deleted the app and redownloaded it and it continues to have the same problem. So in conclusion this app is not my friend."
"I find it absolutely ridiculous that there are certain menu items that can only be ordered online and through the app. This bitter pill would be much easier to swallow if the app would actually work. I recently reinstalled the app so that I could build my own craving box (I had deleted the app and deactivated my account after someone 500 miles away used my account to buy $50 worth of dinner), and after going through the grueling process of getting back in (the first time I installed the app it took forever to make my account, so it wasn‚Äôt just the retrieval process) and making my box I was told that my payment method couldn‚Äôt be processed, so I tried 3 others, and all were declined. I tried again today, and still my payment info was declined. When I spoke with one of the staff at the restaurant she said this was not an uncommon problem and she apologized for the inconvenience. Taco Bell, get your affairs in order. If you aren‚Äôt going to make your full menu available to those of us that order in person, then make sure the method where it is actually works."
"This app used to work well. Now, it is absolutely terrible. Favorited orders never work, toppings have changed and now there is always a ‚Äúpayment error‚Äù message even after using several different cards INCLUDING the one I originally used when signing up and always worked fine. Twice after this error message shows up my account has been charged even though it says it did not go through AND the rewards dissapeared that I earned. I asked staff at location I ordered from and no ordered ever went through. ‚ÄúSorry, nothing we can help with‚Äù I‚Äôve reached out to Taco Bell customer service as well...no response.

**Update**
TB team reached out and attempted to help. They were very apologetic and also added rewards to my account to make up for ones lost due to order errors. However, issue still occurs. I still am unable to make an order through the app  and the rewards I was given from the team have now long expired. Communication stopped and when I asked to delete / deactivate my account I was given no response. I give up and will be deleting the app from my device."
"I have used this app to order food and have gotten the runaround multiple times. If I go inside to pickup, they tell me to go through the drivethru. If I go to the drivethru, they tell me I need to come inside. After multiple failings, I reached out to Taco Bell support. They added some credits to my account, but unfortunately none of them will apply to the food in the cart. I‚Äôve deleted this app, reloaded this app, logged out of the app, logged back into the app. It‚Äôs just a piece of junk, there‚Äôs no way this is convenient and it actually makes things worse than just going to the drivethru and ordering on site.  Which I don‚Äôt really want to do.  I desire an app that works and guaranteed pickup times.  Waste of time.  Frustrating.  Glad Chipotle is close to me, their app works.

Update, the developer responded to contact them.  I did that a week ago and I got the ‚Äúwe‚Äôre working on it‚Äù response.  They reminded me that if my rewards expired, I could follow up once they fixed the issue.  Great, something else to keep track of.  Rewards for an app that may or may not work."
I really do not understand the point of mobile ordering if when you get to the store they don‚Äôt even know what you ordered? I like ordering online with apps because it makes things easier but in this case it just made everything more difficult. When I got to the store they said they couldn‚Äôt find my order and asked what I ordered so they could make it... like no this was an order for 4 people that was made with specific customizations for each person (hence why we ordered on the app to make it easier) so no I can‚Äôt simply tell you what I ordered... I told them to keep looking and then after some time they said they found it and asked if we got drinks and what they were.. What‚Äôs the point of ordering our drinks on the app if they have no clue what they are when we get there. I ended up just asking for cups and getting the drinks myself (after having to call home and check what everyone wanted). There was awful communication with this app and the store I went to. Also just to add I got all the way home and realized they forgot 2 cinnamon twists that came with 2 boxes we got. Never again using this app.
"I was really excited to see one of my favorite restaurants has an app! I wasn‚Äôt aware of the app until I saw an ad for the free chalupa box, but I guess this has been around for a couple of years actually??

The rewards system is pretty cool. And I‚Äôm excited to start earning rewards!

My main problem with this app is the payment methods. I‚Äôve tried to connect a gift card to my account and it says the card doesn‚Äôt exist. I even connected this card to my account via the website, yet it still wouldn‚Äôt work or load up on the app. Also whenever I try to connect a credit card it pops up with an error message and kicks me out.

I also wish the app was more user friendly. It was slightly inconvenient that I really couldn‚Äôt find my way around the app. I was just kind of confused about how to order and how the rewards program works. However, I did eventually find the ‚Äúhow it works‚Äù tab.

One other small bug I‚Äôve found is favoriting menu items. I‚Äôve favorited some items like the grilled cheese burrito and the quesarito, but the favorites tab says I haven‚Äôt favorited anything yet. I go back to favorite those menu items again, and the app tells me I‚Äôve already favorited the item. Again, nothing big but still slightly inconvenient.

I love that Taco Bell has an app and I can‚Äôt wait to keep using it! I know it‚Äôs still kind of in beta testing, but I‚Äôm excited to see how it progresses!"
"Great App that‚Äôs so easy and convenient to use! I just placed my first order through it and I love it! Well done Taco Bell! The one thing that was really disappointing was the basically nonexistent special offers, deals and coupons. I frequently use nearly every fast food chains apps, and I‚Äôm given offers for every chain. Some are pretty good such as Subway you can gain token points for each purchase and after you reach 200 you get $2 off and up and they email you coupons for free sides or special deals. Others like McDonald‚Äôs offers are honestly amazing that have multiple coupons every single day! I know Taco Bell has amazingly low prices but maybe a coupon for a free cinnamon twist or soda maybe would make this app just as good as McDonald‚Äôs and also way better than quite a few of the other competitions! Overall, Taco Bell did a really great job with their new app!"
"If you want to use this app then get ready to be very frustrated with Taco Bell. Out of 50+ orders using this app, my food was made correctly maybe once, and I order the same bean and rice burritos every time. I personally have had to basically train the staff at my local restaurant on how to interpret online orders with their computer, and they still can‚Äôt manage to figure it out. Taco Bell corporate clearly has dished out zero training to employees for orders through the app or website. Update for newest version: gets worse with every update. Last versions were already unresponsive and unreliable, now it‚Äôs just even more unresponsive. Whoever is developing this app is garbage. A MAJORITY of people are literally being scammed of their time and money by using this app and the people responsible are not doing anything about it. I will not eat Taco Bell again after my horrible experiences with this app. I‚Äôve been waiting for someone to make it right after emailing the appropriate persons and making complaint after complaint, but now I know they absolutely do not care. Please do not eat at this garbage excuse for a restaurant."
"Last time I ordered Taco Bell was August 9, 2020. I ordered via the mobile app. When I was submitting my (already on file) payment info to complete the process of placing my order, the app prompted an error: that my payment information had some problem. In order to work around this, I had to re-enter all my payment information. Today, February 4, 2021, the same thing happened-and I already had two of the exact same payment options (pre-populated with the correct info), neither that would suffice for the app. So, I had to re-enter my payment information again (making a second duplicate). None of the other fast food apps have this problem. I order via apps because they are meant to provide convenience and I always appreciate the exclusive incentives they offer, enticing me to do business with them, but a reoccurring erred payment process and weak loyalty program (w/o any deals whatsoever) dissuades me from being a patron."
"Twice this app took the money from my credit card but did not send the order to Taco Bell and froze on ‚Äúoops something went wrong‚Äù. When I went to pick up the order, my order had not gone through. I was trying to show my phone from a distance to the workers in the store who had their masks pulled down their noses tell me I needed to put the order through again, which again didn‚Äôt go through. This used to be a wonderful Taco Bell but my last experience made me feel exposed and unsafe- I sent feedback to Taco Bell which was not responded to and now I don‚Äôt want to go back to this specific Taco Bell which is a shame because before this- the service at this location was amazing. I just wish the staff had kept their masks fully up over their mouths and noses when interacting with me because I couldn‚Äôt explain the issues with my transactions with the workers not completely masked up. Also if I can‚Äôt order remote and have a contact free safe pickup- I can‚Äôt order food from here until COVID is under control."
"Have an issue, what to let them know inside the app‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs a lengthy place to fill out name address phone number problem with what categorically, what restaurant at what time. Followed by a submit button that generates a nonsensical pop up titled ‚Äúuh-oh‚Äù. Now the result is that you can‚Äôt submit this complaint form. But does it tell you that? Nope. Just some randomness with a close button that brings you back to the form. If there is a form error it isn‚Äôt outlined in red I can tell you that much.

Pop up literally says ‚Äú Want to share feedback about your recent Taco Bell visit? Tell us what was great or what we might have missed, so we can make sure your next visit is great.‚Äù

Nothing about your complaint form not being submitted. Nothing instructive about what to do now or next. Just trash after a bad experience (bad food/restaurant/app/customer service), wasted time an money an wasted food cause they couldn‚Äôt prepare as ordered.  Wasted more time to let them know that failed. An Wasting even more time now leaving a bad review cause every step up to now has also failed."
"I haven‚Äôt been able to cash in a single reward all summer. All I get is error messages telling me items in my cart are unavailable and then eventually the reward expires and goes unused. Last night, think since the app was updated recently maybe it was fixed, I placed an order. Upon arriving at the designated restaurant the staff was very rude, claiming they hadn‚Äôt received any online order and telling me there was nothing they could do. She refused to let me speak with management, refused to look at the charges to my account, the order number, or the confirmation email. So I had to reorder everything there at the counter, I wasn‚Äôt able to get two of the items because they‚Äôre apparently ‚Äúonline exclusive‚Äù and it cost me $6 more for two fewer items! Make it make sense!! AND there‚Äôs also STILL a hold on my account for the other order. Two hours later I get a notification that my order has been cancelled but the hold will be on my account for a week! This entire situation is unacceptable. I‚Äôll not be eating at Taco Bell again anytime soon!"
"We placed an order for pick up inside, and the app automatically changed it to drive thru. When I tried to change it again it did the same thing. (Why even give the option at that point?).. The app tells us that drive thru orders don‚Äôt start getting made until you reach the drive thru and let them know your name. This Taco Bell usually has crazy long lines, so I called the store to let them know we were already on our way, and if it would be possible for them to start our order right then. But they hadn‚Äôt received our order in their system. So we thought OK, we‚Äôll just walk in and check again once we‚Äôre there and it‚Äôs had more time. Again, cannot find our order and yet we had already been charged. Using the app was pointless at this point as we had to reorder everything and wait anyways. Was really excited at the idea of skipping the drive thru line, but since that doesn‚Äôt seem to be possible the app isn‚Äôt something I‚Äôll likely be trying to use again. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend unless you like being double charged and wasting your time."
"This app would be useful if it worked, but most of the time it won‚Äôt load, and I‚Äôve had problems on numerous occasions with it getting my order wrong. I‚Äôm vegan, so I need to make sure my orders don‚Äôt have animal products in them, but this app makes that difficult. I save my customized orders by favoriting them so I can quickly add them to an order next time, but every time I‚Äôve done that so far, it didn‚Äôt add the customizations to my order, and I ended up not being able to eat my food. And even when my customizations do end up on my app receipt, it doesn‚Äôt seem to show up for the workers, so when I paid double the price for my burritos by adding extra things, I ended up getting a regular burrito that I couldn‚Äôt even eat, and the workers did not seem happy to remake it and ended up doing it wrong again. In addition, not everything available at my local restaurant is listed on the app, such as when they used to have nacho fries. I wish this app worked so I could quickly get my food when I‚Äôm in a rush, but it seems to only disappoint and take even longer so my order can get remade."
"I‚Äôve used it twice and it wasted a lots of my time each time. It simply does not work if you want to use gift card!!! The first time I used it in store. There was no way to use gift card to submit!!! After fiddling it for a long time, finally a box at the bottom of checkout showed up. After typing something there, It enabled me to submit the order. Today I just tried to use it again. Same thing. But worse. The box for pickup person‚Äôs name didn‚Äôt show up. I had to bring my laptop out to use browser and Wi-Fi at Taco Bell was so slow that I almost want to tether using my phone. Finally I was able to use gift card payment to submit the order. However, the store didn‚Äôt receive the order. And the app doesn‚Äôt show what I had ordered! By the way, don‚Äôt ever try to use Facebook to login. The integration was so bad that it takes forever to login, if ever. I tried to create a direct taco bell account, but they didn‚Äôt allow me to put my gift cards in another account. Those gift cards are expiring soon. It takes so much time to use them. I‚Äôll just let them expire!"
"Selected the wrong location because of the poor map UI.  Your location selection is a slightly larger purple circle (than the normal size purple circles) instead of the red checkbox.  The red checkbox is your ‚Äúcurrent/default store‚Äù and when you go to choose a different store the red check mark doesn‚Äôt change to what you tapped on, it just makes a larger purple circle.  Very easy to make a mistake when you‚Äôre in a rush.  Just a poor UI design compared to other apps I‚Äôve used for location selection.

Additionally after placing an order, if you refresh your orders page it duplicates the order.  Every time you refresh it another copy shows up.  This is a visual bug only luckily but to have an issue like this from such a large company is surprising to say the least.

EDIT:  I apparently lost all my favorites but when I go to make new ones, it says it already exists.  This app is just too buggy and I‚Äôve had these issues for a long time now."
"I always have problems at checkout!  After I submit my card payment (via Apple Pay) the submit button is grayed out so I don‚Äôt know if they received my order or not.  I just updated the app and it was supposed to have ‚Äúbug fixes‚Äù but literally nothing changed.  I even restarted the app several times, still no change!  If you are lucky enough to get the app to work and go to pick up your food, you have to wait for them to make it because they don‚Äôt make it until you get there!  I get that they want the food to be fresh or hot or whatever when you get there but I live only a few blocks away and by the time I get there the food should be ready.  Having to wait for your food to get made defeats the purpose of preordering!  You don‚Äôt save any time if you have to sit and wait for them to make your food."
"Before the update ~6 days ago I only had one problem and that is my card will randomly decline and I have to run it again. I‚Äôve even had to re-enter the exact same payment information again. 

More recently, my favorites disappeared from my list and I cannot add any favorite items back because they are ‚Äúalready a favorite‚Äù. So that‚Äôs a really really annoying bug that should never have happened. Thought that would be fixed on the next bug fix update but after downloading the x.10 update today it is still broken. 

Last slightly annoying thing is Dr Pepper is not an option under drinks and I have to put in a random drink and correct it at the window. The employees aren‚Äôt always receptive to that and make the wrong drink anyways. Then when at the window, particularly yesterday, the woman was visibly irate with having to remake the drink, despite me explaining it to her at the drive thru speaker."
"I have loved this app since I started using it. It was easy to use and did everything I wanted it to. The features were great and it worked great in all the stores I used it at with only occasional glitches that were easily fixed by just restarting the app...

Now every time I try to submit an order it tells me there is an error with the payment. I have seen where the money is sent from my bank and then immediately refunded over and over. I have added and changed the cards to different ones of mine and even other people‚Äôs cards. I logged out and back in. I deleted the app and reinstalled it. This has been going on for weeks. 

I would love to continue using it, it was very convenient, but the only ‚Äúsupport‚Äù I have found is a page of FAQs and I don‚Äôt need those answers. Right now it‚Äôs completely unusable."
Since the menu has changed now people cannot afford the food anymore the poor people that is it‚Äôs like y‚Äôall changed it to so nobody else can afford unless you got money. We will come up here just about every night to order the beef burrito for a dollar so we would get like eight or nine at time it was filling and it would fill us up good and have leftovers but now you guys have to jack the price from one dollar to two dollars and now this poor folk can‚Äôt afford anything on the menu is it. Well we can buy one or two but that‚Äôs not enough for us. I will sit in line for 20 minutes and we get to the menu board and the menu has changed within a cpl days. Then we get to the menu board just to be to cards only. And sat at the menu board for five min before being told that. Were hungry and work so hard but we just had to move so bills are higher this month with paying a deposit and 2 kids. Please put the beef burrito back on the menu.
"UPDATE:  After writing this review I did get assistance to get back into my account.   I would like to give this app 5 stars but when the only way to obtain support is to write a 1-star review the user experience is diminished. So I had to knock off a star.

I have Been using the app for several months and it was great‚Ä¶until one day I got locked out and can not get back in. Similar to the other review seems to be a major issue. The forgot password link never sends the email although I still get promotion emails. Including the one to tell me to use my reward before it expires. Zero app support.  Only way through email is to say you had an issue with a visit‚Ä¶and then it wants the location. Very frustrating. Finally found a phone number for them to put in a ticket. I may get a email in 3 Business days‚Ä¶but not holding out hope."
"I really don‚Äôt understand the point of even using this app. You wait in line the same amount of time, especially since it doesnt give you the option to pick up inside even though my store is open inside (and also has a sign out front saying they‚Äôre open for pick up/carry out?) 
I used the app to order the build your own box and it let me select every option and when I tried to put it in the cart, it said one of the items wasnt available, but didnt say which item so I had to go back and make different versions of the order to see what I COULD put in. 
During this whole process, the app crashed three times. 
So while I‚Äôm sitting behind 5 cars in the drive thru, it asked me to rate the app. I started writing my review and the app crashed again. I tried to reopen it and it‚Äôs now stuck on a purple ‚Äúloading‚Äù icon. 
So I‚Äôm in the app store finishing what I had started on the app. Overall, this app is just an incredibly frustrating waste of time."
"This is the first time that I decided to use the Taco Bell app and so far it went out without a hitch I ordered it at 8:13 I‚Äôm gonna go inside to pick it up as I will be ready in less than 10 minutes they were a few things when ordering I never knew you could do in all the time I‚Äôve been eating at T Bell  Like customizing your order changing refried beans for black beans etc.,which we thought was pretty cool and now I am on my way to go pick it up from inside the store will see if it‚Äôs ready and I will finish this review after I pick up my food. So is 828 I‚Äôm walking out of the Taco Bell with my order through no fault of their own as there was an Drunk person in front of me that made things difficult for the cashier but all in all a great experience I like that it was ready for me and give this the thumbs up"
"Just updated the App, tried to order again after the poor experience I had several months ago. Hey, everyone deserves a second chance. 
Well I placed my order at 12:37 am and got to the store at 12:51 am at 2918 E Whitmore Ave in Ceres, CA. I had my mind set on getting some Taco Bell after working the swing shift. Only to have the employee tell me my order is not in the system. I showed them the confirmation email, they just said to pull into the parking lot and wait. How long? I asked, ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know‚Äù was the sad response I got. I canceled my order at the window. She didn‚Äôt even offer to take my order at the window. She was willing to let a customer leave rather than make a sale. I was so disappointed that I didn‚Äôt get to order food. This is the straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back. If I ever decide to go back, I‚Äôm not ordering via the App and May look for another location. Despite this being on my way home from work. This Taco Bell has good food but poor customer service. I hope management will provide training to these employees."
"Love the app, but please make this one improvement! My local TB has more drink options than are shown on the app and multiple times I have gotten the wrong drink. For example, the app forces me to pick Pepsi. I pull up in drive through and ask for Dr Pepper instead because I couldn‚Äôt select it in the app. I leave with Pepsi. I don‚Äôt want Pepsi. I want what I asked for. Make it easy on me and the hard working TB employees in drive thru. Let me select a generic fountain drink to make it easier for employees to remember my order change or let me add instructions to the order when submitting it. 

Update 4/14: Thanks for adding the Dr Pepper option, but any order I place with a Dr Pepper is getting an error ‚Äúinvalid product group‚Äù when I try to checkout

Update 10/04: Dev team has addressed all my concerns. Great work team! Love this app!"
"I downloaded the Taco Bell ordering application while connected to the Taco Bell Wi-Fi at the store location. The application indicated that my order had been received and I proceeded into the lobby area. I sat down and continued to observe the order status moving from ‚Äúorder received‚Äù to ‚Äúmy order was being made‚Äù. After approximately 15 minutes the order status did not change to ‚Äúorder completed‚Äù. I waited an additional 10 minutes while observing an online customer coming in to pick up their order and be told that it was not completed yet. I approached the employee at the counter and asked how to receive a refund for an order that was clearly never received. I presented her with the application pulled up on my phone and she confirmed my correct location, but could not confirm they have received the order. A gentleman in the back spoke up and indicated that I would need to get a refund from the application as they cannot provide one at the store. I have filed a dispute with my credit card company to prevent the charges from remaining. Terrible Customer Service"
"I am so frustrated by the Taco Bell app.  I have reached out to support many many times, and they all tell me it‚Äôs a known issue with the rewards tab, but it never ever gets fixed on a permanent basis.

I have an iPhone 12 Pro Max (although I had a problem on my iPhone 11 Pro Max also) and I am in the Fire level for rewards.  They told me they know they have an issue with that and they‚Äôre working on it.  But nothing gets fixed permanently.  I have lost out on so many rewards cause they expire.

While I can order and somewhere the system has all my points and rewards, I cannot see my points when I go to the rewards app.  I also can never redeem any rewards since this tab does not work properly.  I have dealt with this at least since October 2020, and it‚Äôs now almost June 2021.

As a matter of fact, I was so surprised earlier today cause it started working again.  But guess what?  I was ready to go to Taco Bell just now and discovered the app wasn‚Äôt working yet again.

I wish someone at Taco Bell would be made aware of this and actually fix it.  After months of calling, it seems to have gone on deaf ears and they just don‚Äôt care that I‚Äôm having problems.  Very sad cause I love Taco Bell.  And I‚Äôm a very loyal customer, but I have lost many many rewards over this, and still continue to order through the app, even though I know I can never redeem any rewards or see how many points I have."
"This isnt about the app, just came to complain about the work. Taco Bell is so disorganized. I‚Äôve worked here for about a month. I‚Äôve worked twice not including training the entire month. I was told I‚Äôd get paid for my training hours as well which I was not. 10$ an hour. They wouldn‚Äôt let me work for 2 weeks out of the month I‚Äôve been here. I recently applied for Rally‚Äôs because there are good reviews and seems like a much better environment. I had not yet put in my 2 weeks for Taco Bell because I was waiting to hear back from rallys if I had gotten the job or not. I had just received an email (Dec 6: 11:00pm) about my work experience at Taco Bell and ‚Äúwhy I decided to leave the company‚Äù I had not said anything to them about leaving yet. I don‚Äôt know whether to confront them or just tell them I‚Äôm leaving and not mention the email? What I‚Äôm getting at, though, is that Taco Bell is the worst place to work at for anyone considering it I hope you see this review I don‚Äôt know where else to post this review but I will figure it out."
"Ordered breakfast from the app, tried to use the store I go to often and always get breakfast from, app said it ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt available‚Äù but gave me a different store nearby. Chose that, placed my order, and even got a text that the order was ready. Have to drive to this different store downtown, located in a mall, pay for parking, decent walk in to the store. After $8 of parking and a 10 minute walk I get to the counter just to be told they don‚Äôt serve breakfast items. I ask why I wasn‚Äôt notified? Man at the store said they have no way to reach customers on the app. I said okay just refund it please. He said he can‚Äôt do that either, and to do it on the app. I go to my app, there is no where to request this or even a customer service line listed. I have to google the number and call through them, and even that person told me the ‚Äúmobile team‚Äù will have to look at it. This app isn‚Äôt trustworthy if it lets you order menu items from stores that don‚Äôt offer those items, and tells you the order is ready for you when it isn‚Äôt and won‚Äôt be"
"I hate this app. It never updates. Either the new combos are unavailable to purchase through the app, but it‚Äôs available at the store I‚Äôm going to. Or, it‚Äôll let me purchase the combo on the app and then when I get there, they never sell what‚Äôs available on the app. So many times my order has gone through on the app but not to the store and I have to repurchase there and wait up to 10 days for my funds to return. The last few times I‚Äôve attempted, it‚Äôd tell me it had a problem processing my card. I even attempted to buy a gift card but received the same error. I‚Äôve updated my app, deleted and redownloaded, only to experience the same issues! I‚Äôm hungry haha. Your lines are too long and the app is the best way. But what‚Äôs the point when the app can‚Äôt even get the orders?"
"I love taco bell because it‚Äôs one of the only fast food places in my area that‚Äôs vegan/vegetarian friendly, but i haven‚Äôt been able to order from the app in i can‚Äôt remember how long. 
it‚Äôs super frustrating, it usually allows me to place the order and it charges my card, but then it notifies me that some items are unavailable (even if that‚Äôs not true) and cancels the order before refunding me later. 
idk if it‚Äôs the fact that there‚Äôs always items on the menu that aren‚Äôt really available (like cinnabon bites and always stay on the menu even if they‚Äôve been gone for months). something always prevents me from completing an order. 
i always end up having to go through postmates because my order never reached the store. it would be great if i could use the app because going through a third party takes money away from me and the business... hopefully they fix it."
"This app is terrible! First I had a small panic attack when I went to pick up my order and the app wouldn‚Äôt load with my receipt. Then secondly there was this horrible experience of using a coupon with the app. I got one from T-Mobile for one free item and it worked; I put my free taco in my cart and it said 0.00 next to it so, so far so good. Then I checked out and suddenly AFTER I‚Äôve been charged, my price has gone up. For me, not a problem but for someone who had EXACTLY the right amount in their account, it‚Äôs a huge problem. Not to mention dishonest. Already shaken by that, I go to the store to try to sort it out and I‚Äôm told to my face there‚Äôs nothing I can do and nothing the people in the store can do because I went through the app. So now I‚Äôm mad because that‚Äôs my money and you‚Äôre telling me that your app can make a mistake and take money that it wasn‚Äôt entitled to and there‚Äôs nothing to be done about it? And I was told that I wasn‚Äôt the only one with this problem!! Fix this; don‚Äôt agree to any coupons if your app will mess up and charge people anyway."
"I‚Äôve had this app for MONTHS and have placed MANY orders on it and I have yet to receive any type of offer. Other fast food chain apps constantly have coupons on their app. I love Taco Bell, it is my favorite fast food restaurant, I just wish they would get it together with these offers! My birthday just passed and it would‚Äôve been nice to get a free meal or taco or something! 

Other than that, I love the convenience of the app. I LOVE that I can customize my order and tell them to put less sauce/cheese, even though it‚Äôs not always done by the employees. I‚Äôve had a few glitches here and there where the store never received my order, but they never made me pay again and they just made my order for me. 

If there were ever offers I would totally change my review to 5 stars, but what is the point of an offers tab if there‚Äôs never offers? I‚Äôll just be here waiting, with my cheesy Gordita crunch üåÆ(with beans instead of meat, less cheese, and less sauce)"
"I had gone to two separate Taco Bells because the first one said their system wasn‚Äôt updated to accept online orders. After several failed attempts of placing an order, due to the slow running program, the app ended up charging the full amount of my order to my debit card after I had selected for use of $20 in bonus cards. I was only supposed to be charged $1 and some change for the remaining balance. I‚Äôm frustrated because I couldn‚Äôt get a hold of anyone by phone through the holidays, so I sent an email to Taco Bell customer care and it has now been almost three weeks with no response. Of course now my bonus cards have disappeared because they have expired. So my suggestion is to make orders through their website in the computer if you have online gift cards because the app has serious glitches. Also, after the e-gift cards are used up, no more online purchases will be made from my end. With the poor customer service response time, or lack there of, I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôll be continuing with this establishment."
"I‚Äôve used this app before and it worked fine. Used it tonight and it was disastrous. Placed my order at a specific restaurant and the app said the order was placed and all I had to do was check in at the drive thru. Pulled in to the drive thru and they tell us that they hadn‚Äôt received a mobile order. I double checked the address on my app and it was correct. Initially their only solution was that they don‚Äôt control the app and that basically it wasn‚Äôt their problem. I try to be understanding in customer service situations because I know it‚Äôs not always easy but, they left us sitting at the microphone in the drive thru for ten minutes after only saying they didn‚Äôt have an order. They didn‚Äôt do anything extra as follow up. They told us they don‚Äôt control the app but neither do I as the customer. Thankfully in the end one employee took our order and eventually got it to us. Not so sure we would‚Äôve gotten our order if not for him."
"I‚Äôve used it three times. Never again. The store in League City, TX on West Main will not follow the instructions if you use the app, but they will gladly up charge you on everything. Two times now they said they did not get my order on ‚Äútheir side.‚Äù I paid for my meal 3 times, twice on the app and once with cash, before being able to get my food tonight. Their best response was, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do anything about it.‚Äù They repeatedly asked me if I ordered from the correct restaurant, multiple people came on the speaker asking me to confirm the address I ordered from like I was some kind of idiot. Yes, I‚Äôm sure I didn‚Äôt pick the other one 20 minutes away. When I asked if I would get a refund the manger said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. That has nothing to do with us.‚Äù Reassuring crew you‚Äôve got here. What‚Äôs the point of the app if it slows the whole process of fast food down. They wouldn‚Äôt even look at the order on my phone. The app logs out of itself and then you‚Äôre stuck trying to remember a password before you get to the window."
"How can you not love this beautiful Mexican-American food chain? For just under $10 dollars, one can fill up today, and tomorrow for hung over breakfast. If I could eat Taco Bell for all three meals and two snacks throughout the day, 2 things would happen. I would become another statistic to American obesity, and I would become supremely happy. When I die, cater my funeral and let there be as many Doritos Locos Tacos as you can fit into one building. 
All of this being said, we are living in a trying time at the current writing of this review. There being an app to ease the pain of ordering my beautiful burrito-quesadilla hybrid know as a Quesarito almost brings me to tears. Thank you for this beautiful platform for my cheesy, beefy tubes of wonder. Thank you. May God bless you until I see you again. 

I remain,
Big Chorizo"
"I‚Äôve use the app since it first launched, and gave it an abundance of time for the developers to clear up bugs. It constantly crashes, repeatedly logs me out, I‚Äôve been double charged for my order (and have yet to receive a refund!), I‚Äôve been charged for my order then shown up at the location and the restaurant tells me they have no information of my order. Honestly this app creates way more headaches than just waiting to go through the line. I liked the idea of it because I have so many food allergies and preferences that I just thought it would be easier for me to set favorites so the information would be typed out for the line cooks instead of me trying to communicate multiple substitutions and add-ons to the cashier.. 
I suppose though in the long run, I am grateful that the app is absolute garbage. It has caused me to eat far less Taco Bell. So, thanks for that I guess. Feeling much healthier without consuming your product on a regular basis due to the terrible mobile ordering experience. Deleting the app now. Wasted storage space."
"I always have issues with this app where I can‚Äôt view the full details of my customized order. Most recently I had a bacon chalupa club combo and tried to customize it so that I did not have avocado ranch or cheese on it. Fortunately what I got had no cheese but it still had the ranch. The weird thing isn‚Äôt on the service end but the way the computer processed my order, which I would imagine is the fault of the app. The receipt shifted the customization options to the second taco on the order, including an addition of jalape√±os I also didn‚Äôt get on the chalupa as ordered. Didn‚Äôt get any period. Tacos were as ordered but I really wonder why it always shifts my options to different items on my order. Can‚Äôt rate this app any higher as long as this issue persists."
"There recently has been an improvement in how often the app works. However, I still experience the app freezing, deleting all items in my cart, and the checkout process still occasionally doesn‚Äôt work (I‚Äôve lost track of how many times I‚Äôve had to enter my card info...again and again and again)

If you reset the app and retry once or twice, it tends to finally work. But it is still pretty frustrating and usually not worth the hassle if you‚Äôre only buying one or two items. I mainly use it when ordering for my family so I can get down what everyone wants. 

Another issue is that items will appear that are not actually available at my store (and I‚Äôm not told until I‚Äôm being handed my food). They typically offer me something else in place. Not a huge deal, I just stick to the basics to avoid it. The employees always seem really confused as if I somehow created a new item myself, haha."
"At one point in time, this app was THE best fast food app. I love Taco Bell and I like to be able to customize my orders. I‚Äôve never been able to get the people at the counter to understand what I want, but the app was great for that. I could (and have) spend $50 on an order at TB, but I literally have not gone in 2 months now. 

It all started when the app updated and changed completely. My first order submitted, but according to the restaurant, never went through on their end. I tried clearing it out and resubmitting it twice before just giving up. The next time, it wouldn‚Äôt even let me check out. It kept giving me errors when I tried to type in my card number and (despite having an Apple Pay button) said that Apple Pay was not compatible for whatever reason. My third and final attempt and using this train-wreck of an app found me having to launch the app again after every single item was added to the cart. That‚Äôs right, it crashed every time I added an item. Oh yeah, and it wouldn‚Äôt let me pay again. USELESS."
"Not sure if it was a system issue at the Location i ordered from, but they literally had us drive to a farther location because they said they never recieved my order. Albeit I had already paid for the food at this point through the app. If not I would have just placed a new order at the drive thru because at this point it‚Äôs an hour later and the only two Taco Bell‚Äôs near me are saying they don‚Äôt have my order. So I go back to the original location and have to show them through the application that I DID order from their location as it had already been paid for. After showing the proof of purchase they still refused to give me my order that I paid for over an hour ago at this point (the location is literally 3 mins away from my home) so you can imagine my frustration. The morning shift manager had to be called to approve the meal, once I finally received the food I rushed home without checking the food andddd the order was wrong. Most unpleasant experience. Save your time and just order in store."
"I have tried twice now to use two different rewards on the app. The first time the employees told me that because they were a KFC/Taco Bell, that they weren‚Äôt a real Taco Bell and couldn‚Äôt let me use the reward. The second time was a free Dorito taco. I ordered and pulled to the window. There was no way for them to scan and take the taco price off of my total. They told me that I would have to order through the app. When I tried to do that, it was showing the total of the taco with no discount. Both times the employees (at two different locations) just promoed my food and didn‚Äôt even bother with the app. Not user friendly at all and the employees don‚Äôt know how to use it either apparently! I guess I shouldn‚Äôt have expected something similar to the Chick-fil-A app from Taco Bell!"
"From other reviews I‚Äôve read (and my own experience) it looks like Taco Bell is making a lot of money without having to give food to people! I had a difficult time trying to place the order, it would not let me use multiple gift cards for some reason even though the amount would have been more than sufficient for my order total, so I had to use one and my debit card for the remainder, then while trying to place the order it suddenly charged me the correct total from what I was trying to order without me pressing ‚Äúsubmit‚Äù. I never received any sort of order confirmation/receipt which I immediately knew was going to be an issue.

No order was submitted to Taco Bell. No proof=no food/refund. Do NOT give anyone an e-gift card to Taco Bell, it is a scam and you might as well throw that money in the trash! My $20 in e-gift cards I received for Christmas all vanished and went unused. I got sick of jumping through all of the hoops trying to get someone to help me, I finally said forget it and promptly deleted that scam of an app they created."
"The worst food app ive used. Ordered for the first time using the app (since i had used many other fast food and restaurant apps with great results) ordered our food while we were leaving a family members house to pick up on our way home (10 min drive from the taco bell). We received the ‚Äúpull in and tell them your name‚Äù email and headed to the restaurant. Pulled in the drive thru to a very rude employee saying our order could take over 15 minutes to receive and that they had no record. I asked if she would like to see the confirmation and was told i needed to keep going in circles around the drive thru until they received it. After waiting in line behind 3 cars we pulled back through to another no record...after an argument about my card already being charge (30 minutes after we placed the order) the order conveniently ‚Äúpopped‚Äù up....i wont be ordering from taco bell again, but if you are, id suggest just doing the old fashion drive thru order - its 30 minutes quicker.
This the temple, texas on adams avenue location"
"I‚Äôve loved my app and been able to use it until recently. It wouldn‚Äôt let me place an order until I was already in the drive thru (I kept refreshing, reset phone, closed app, etc.). Every time I go to place an order, it allows me to add items to my cart, but when I check out, it won‚Äôt let me go through to payment because it says ‚Äúuh oh it looks like your location is closing soon‚Äù even though the hours on the app for my location say 9am-3am (which is correct). I tried to place an order 3 days ago at 9pm, yesterday at 11am, and today around 10am and it will not go through to payment and ordering‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs just a pain because I‚Äôd like to just pull up and be able to quickly get my food and pay with my gift card through the app but I can‚Äôt order nor pay until I get there because of this. Please do another update to fix this."
"So I placed a order online to be picked up in store and when I got to the store the doors were locked seemingly for no reason. I tried to call them 3 times to cancel the order, the drive through was long and no exaggeration this Taco Bell‚Äôs drive through will cost like 20 minutes of your time so I wasn‚Äôt doing that. I saw that they completed my order as if it had been picked up 25 minutes after placing it. Had to wait until the next day to call corporate for the issue and after several minutes going over this and confirming all details of payment order number location and all that I was told someone would be in contact. They should‚Äôve just handled it then and there. A week later I‚Äôm not refunded and have heard from no one at Taco Bell so now I get to call again. 
My issue with all this is that they are wasting my time instead of just dealing with their mess up. 
If your doors are going to be locked don‚Äôt have in store pick up as an option."
"***UPDATE*** Taco Bell responded to this asking me to email them about my experience. I gave them details on dates, order numbers, issues, cost, and when I reached out to customer service or did a survey. They responded asking if I‚Äôve contacted customer service. Obviously they never read my email. I responded and haven‚Äôt heard back in weeks. What a joke. They don‚Äôt care! 
At least 4 times now, I‚Äôve ordered using the app, check in, get to the window and they tell me what I ordered isn‚Äôt available. They‚Äôre out.  I ask to cancel the item and I‚Äôm told they can‚Äôt do that because I ordered through the app and I should cancel the order and then do an order in person. Problem is that the app never cancels the order by that point. Its too late. It‚Äôs a major issue. I end up paying for things I don‚Äôt get. It‚Äôs a rip off! And I fill out a complaint online each time and no one ever replies. They don‚Äôt care about their customers. Take your business elsewhere."
"I have used this app before and I really enjoyed it, but ever since they updated the app I can‚Äôt get logged in. I have tried using just my email and password, I tried logging in through Facebook and nothing works! I even tried to create a new account and it tells me the email is in use already! I tried reseting my phone incase it has something to fo with the connectivity can‚Äôt login. I tried reinstalling the app still can‚Äôt login. I‚Äôm about ready to just give up on this app which is a shame. I have used it many times in the past and had great experiences and now that I‚Äôm bed bound it would be very handy to be able to pay for my food so that I don‚Äôt have to bother people to come up to my 3rd story apartment more then once to deliver food when I‚Äôm craving a flippin chalupa!"
"Tried this app tonight because my order is a little more difficult than most so I figured it would be easy to just input the modifications and stuff myself. That was not the case. I went thru the drive thru and was informed my order hadn‚Äôt showed up yet, but to pull forward to the window. Waited for someone at the window to let me know the order had showed up, or ask me what it was so they could make it for me then. Instead no one spoke to me at all, they just handed me an order after a minute and I pulled away only to discover this was definitely not my order. According to the people inside my order never showed up so I basically had to order twice and deal with the somewhat surly people working who assumed I sent my order to the wrong store or something (I did not). I‚Äôm also confused as to why they just handed off food to me without me even paying or anything lol.. but that‚Äôs probably more an issue with the store (which I actually used to work at so I can vouch for their un-professionalism)"
"This app used to be the gold standard of fast food mobile ordering. Since the major update, it‚Äôs been almost unusable. Put aside the usual ‚Äúnow where did they move that thing I‚Äôm used to‚Äù and lost saved settings, those can be expected I guess. But this new app is buggy and harder to navigate. Took me 15 mins to try and place my order today. Every time I saved my customized menu items, it never added them to my cart properly. In the end, I just had to assume the ‚Äúchicken soft taco no sour cream‚Äù that was in my cart was actually the ‚Äúgrilled chicken taco, no lettuce, add beans‚Äù that I ordered. Then, the app sent my order to the wrong restaurant! Event though I checked multiple times to make sure it was right before sending. When I tried to fix it, I had to try three times to get it to the right restaurant because ‚Äúthere are no times available at this restaurant today, please select another location.‚Äù My experience today is the worst I‚Äôve had with this app, but the problems have been mounting since the update."
"Use to work for me. Now, no more. Log in screen keeps says ‚Äúlog in failed‚Äù. Ok, I KNOW my info is correct. I use a password keeper, Apple auto fills and all info is correct. I have app send me a ‚Äúreset password‚Äù email. Reset password. Takes me direct to online site (not app). Logs in fine. Has a banner prompt to open in app. Click on that since it‚Äôs what I wanted to begin with. Enter email/password that just worked online - ‚Äúlog in failed‚Äù. Now I try creating new account. ‚ÄúEmail already in use.‚Äù Ok, confirmed that‚Äôs not the issue. Try logging it several times with info I know is correct, after closes/resetting app. App is up to date. Restarting phone. Nope. Go to App Store to click on ‚Äúsupport‚Äù link under leave a review. Clicking on support does NOTHING. Scroll down to ‚Äúreport a problem ‚Äú‚Ä¶.goes to a ‚Äúsorry that page can‚Äôt be found‚Äù‚Ä¶!!!!!! So here I am with my only recourse left. 1 star review and no longer able to order via app. Which means‚Ä¶next place for dinner!"
I downloaded the Taco Bell App I‚Äôve been trying to place a order through the Taco Bell App since yesterday because I have a Taco Bell Gift Card but the Taco Bell App wouldn‚Äôt allow me to place a order because of a overwhelming amount of customers error I was prompted to try again every 5mins I wasn‚Äôt able to order from the Taco Bell App until today When I placed my order I assumed my order was completed because My payment was already accepted but there was a small text saying I could either wait 15mins more or place more order now I realize I‚Äôve been waiting for food that wasn‚Äôt actually ordered I pressed order now to complete my order I was given my order and I walked away from counter I realized I wasn‚Äôt given my drink I purchased I couldn‚Äôt get a employees attention when I got home I didn‚Äôt have any sauce I ordered at all and I didn‚Äôt have any napkins worst experience I did want a refund for my drink I wasn‚Äôt given any options through Taco Bell App
"Twice now, on my phone and my husbands phone, the app has halted our dinner plans due to its incompetence. For me, the app crashed after placing an order, it didn't send an email and when I checked orders in the app nothing was listed,  but it still took money out of my account!!! I assumed the order went through since I paid for it. but when I got to the window they had no record of it and I went home empty handed. It took several days to get my money back, and that was all the money I had that night. Thanks for the box of mac&cheese for dinner Taco Bell. My husband to my reluctance tried the app again the other day,  had an order confirmed and ""sent "", received an email confirmation and an order number, had money taken out of his account... And when he pulled up to the window they had no record of it again. It also took 3 days to get the money back, and I ended up having to drive out to Taco Bell and placing the order the old fashioned way. 

I will never use this app again."
"I‚Äôve been able to use this app a total of 1 time since I downloaded it months ago. On that one occasion, I had no issue. Found a 15% off coupon, ordered my food, made it to the restaurant, ate, and went about my business. Well the next time I tried to check for anymore coupons/deals, I can‚Äôt sign in at all. It says ‚ÄúLog in failed.‚Äù So I tried again. Still failed. Closed the app and tried again. Still failed. I‚Äôve tried several more times since then to log in with no success. I see no point in having an app to pre-order my food on when it gets me the same results as going to the restaurant and ordering in person. I can‚Äôt log in to use the deals, and from what I understand from other reviews, the deals are basically nonexistent now anyway. Plus, as some others have mentioned in their reviews, they don‚Äôt start making your food until you check in at the location, so you end up waiting the same amount of time as you would if you‚Äôd just gone in the store and ordered in person."
"I finally got this app to do what I need to do place an order. The first time I tried to use this app, I did not know that to remove an item from my cart I have to double tap and hold and swipe to the left because I am blind and use accessibility software. It told me nowhere on the app that I need to do this. Another issue I have is that menu items are not described unless you click them and click customize. Finally, it just takes a long time to get an order placed make sure that is correct and pay for my item. When selecting my pick up time, it didn‚Äôt seem to want to tell me what Times I could do that. I finally got it to do it but it was very confusing. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this review and consider these issues. If these issues can be fixed, it will be a great application, and I will be glad to update my review and give it more stars."
"This revolutionary app has updated my world of food! It makes it easy as a button to save your creative creations including your beefy five layer customization! Best of all you can order your food ahead of time, like while running errands, to ensure your food stays warm and you can get back home to your families! Before I got the app I really didn‚Äôt know what items I could just add to my burritos or quesadillas but now they are all outlined in front of me ! Like my famous chicken quesadilla add steak spicy ranch and make it supreme! By downloading this app your are not only saving time but also money! So please do YOURSELF a favor and download the app today! 

(Not paid or sponsored by Taco Bell inc. but hopefully in the near future they will notice me.) have a great day, and hello Taco Bell customer service employee, (please do a piece on me!)"
"I dont have means of transportation so I tried to deliver food to my house. Tried. I put three items in my cart and then when I went to enter a delivery adress I would enter my address in the box i was directed to do so in. It would NOT work I tried many times do enter my address, but every time I did it i would press the ""check for delivery box"" and it would do anything. Also its not that i wrote my address wrong I tried many times, I personoly typed it out 15+ times, I assumed that I was typing it wrong. I thrn went to google maps typed my address COPIED and PASTED the address GOOGLE MAPS gave me for the location i lived at. It still wouldnt let me press the ""check for delivery"" box.

Though I cant deliver food to my address I really like the app, its easy to find store location, finding food and costomizing food is at easy access, but one of the biggest reason the Taco Bell app is a thing is to deliver the food.

Any way, the app is pretty good despite the major flaw."
"Hi there,
It seems like the app has two tabs on the order menu (Groups and Value Menu) which both show the same items (those being the offerings for Groups, such as taco and burrito packs), and this leads me to believe that either this is an app error or that all value items have been removed from the menu. If the former is true, I hope that this error is rectified soon; however, if it is the latter, I find this business decision to be extremely limiting. Taco Bell has long been a bastion of value level purchases, a perk of which I‚Äôve gratefully been the beneficiary for quite a long time. It has the perfect items for when you need something to eat but you‚Äôre not in the mood for an overpriced offering or a large meal. Unfortunately, I currently find myself in this predicament without such solutions at my disposal. I hope that this mistake was accidental, but if not, I hope that this decision will be reconsidered in the future."
"The app is a great idea and helps from taking forever at the drive with what you want. However, ever since they updated the app with rewards you cannot sign back in. I have tried uninstalling the app and reinstalling it and still doesn‚Äôt work. Makes it scary since my credit card information is saved on my account, but this a bug that has been going on for more than two weeks now. Compared to competitors its is surprising that Taco Bell is so slow with app maintenance. Bugs need to be fixed before adding more features.

*After getting reached out by the team I have changed my review. Everything has been fixed and they were swiftly in their responses. Heres to less bugs lol. Good customer service.*"
"I love the Taco Bell app, it makes it way easier to customize my meals to make them vegetarian. Unfortunately, after one of the previous updates it stopped working for me. I can no longer log in to my account to get the deals or rewards or to save my favorite orders (which was a feature I really liked). Whenever I go to the log in screen it says ‚Äúlog in failed‚Äù in red at the top of the screen. I tried to sign up for a new account and it said ‚Äúsign up failed. please enter valid email ID‚Äù, probably because an account already exists with my email. I also tried to sign up with facebook but every time I do, it just takes me back to the sign up page without logging me in or anything. Please help me fix this issue. I visit Taco Bell frequently because it‚Äôs my favorite fast food place and I appreciate all the vegetarian options offered! I‚Äôd really like to be able to log in so I can take full advantage of all the app‚Äôs features!"
"Every time I have to do an order I have to reload my credit card information and it won‚Äôt except the password that Taco Bell established for me already. It wouldn‚Äôt be an issue if I didn‚Äôt have to order the thing I like off the app because it‚Äôs unavailable in the stores that I go to unless I use the app it‚Äôs very frustrating to have to deal with this every time I come to your restaurant and that‚Äôs why I gave it one star.

UPDATE: 16 Feb 2021 I reloaded the new version of the app. I again had to reload my credit card information that I‚Äôve loaded now 12 times just to make an order. All of my past orders or nonexistent getting no points for my orders I‚Äôve had this app for two years and still only have 120 points you‚Äôve guys have had since 2015 to fix this. This is the most pathetic app that I‚Äôve ever used in the fact that I can‚Äôt order certain things unless I use it is a constant source of irritation to me in an otherwise good company."
"I‚Äôve used the app 3 times & my order has been incorrect every time. It was pretty easy to customize items & those were done correctly but items were missing all 3 times. This last time I ordered, I wanted drive thru pick up but when my text notification came thru it said to come inside to pickup. I got 2 notices that my order was ready for pickup (I live 1 mi away) & when I went in to pick up was told it needed to be prepared. Then when I was leaving with my order, I realized they had not given me my drink or offered any sauce packets or napkins. The pickup order before mine was missing their drink as well. A disappointing app &saved no time. The missing items in my order were substituted with less expensive menu items, so I lost money."
"The convenience of online ordering is awesome. Ease of use for app, I would consider fair. If I had not gone through ahead of time and selected some of my favorites, it would have been quite time consuming in my opinion. Then there was a slight snag at the end when it came to checkout. I wanted to select ‚Äúcheckout‚Äù, but then it would not allow me to move forward in the process. So you had to choose ‚Äúcontinue shopping‚Äù and then it would allow checkout!! I‚Äôm not certain how convenient this is for the person stuck behind you in line though, as I opted for drive-thru pick up?? I suppose it‚Äôs all relative, 6 to 1 or half a dozen to the other. I will definitely be using the app again, it was a good experience overalls!! Thanks Taco Bell, you scored a home run with me!!!!

"I downloaded the app for the rewards... To be honest there‚Äôs no rewards; at least not anymore.
 The app also doesn‚Äôt show the entire menu, so if you want to buy current new things like meal deals or their newest products they don‚Äôt show it, or it‚Äôs so hidden you don‚Äôt find it.
 You also can‚Äôt tell them you want stuff on the side like red sauce, sour cream etc. It‚Äôs not an option. Also used to be able to tell the store you were pulling into the parking lot or were close by so they could start making your order... That no longer happens either. Additionally if you pick a drink and it‚Äôs a fountain drink then you have to wait to get there to tell them what it is. 

Last time, it took them half an hour to make my order because they refused to make it until I arrived. They regularly forget stuff so always triple check your orders. 

Not the most reliable, I‚Äôve definitely seen better. If you want to partially customize your order, then do it here but know you won‚Äôt get your order early, you‚Äôre not jumping the line (if there is one), and triple check everything.

Thirdly and this is the biggest issue I have with the app... you can‚Äôt pay in store. You HAVE to pay in the app. Every other app I have gives me the option to pay when I arrive to pick up my family‚Äôs meal. This doesn‚Äôt. The only reason we keep the app is to check hours & to view the menu. If I could give a 1/2 star I would."
"App is great, but wish they would not allow you to pick up order in store when the ""in store"" portion is closed. You still have to wait in line and the app is pointless at my location as you still have to wait in line, they won't make your order until you physically tell them your there. You can say you're ""there"" on the app but doesn't matter. The folks inside are rather nice and very courteous, but my location is short handed and lines always wrap around the building and people constantly leave. Westfield indiana Taco Bell is not my favorite choice and we often choose against it bc of this reason. Don't get me wrong. Love Taco Bell and this app would be beneficial if there was an online order lane or the option to skip the line, but in my mind, the only beneficial option this serves is knowing what you want and customizing before hand. Hope this app helps and I'm done venting now. Lol."
"This app never works correctly.  It doesn‚Äôt recognize your login.  Currently there are vegetarian items they added but they say $0.00; however when you add them to your order the price is still $0.00 and it won‚Äôt let you check out.  We‚Äôve waited a long time for fast food veggie options and it‚Äôs here but we can‚Äôt place an order.  Also when it‚Äôs close to closing within the 1 hr the app won‚Äôt let you order.  On the flip side, when you can order, the drive though says there isn‚Äôt enough staff and to cancel your order when you get there.  Finally, when we do order via the app - we get vegetarian; however, often they often don‚Äôt read the order and confuse it with the meat option instead (only to get home to see that there is nothing we can eat bc all meat). Please fix the app issues with login and also the new menu items so we can try them!!!"
"Taco Bell online is AWESOME in terms of getting your cart prepared, the customization options are amazing. Downloaded the app because I kept getting an error trying to pay with Apple Pay through their online website. Like, literally the moment after I left a store where I used my Apple Pay, the Taco Bell website says there‚Äôs a problem. So I try again. And again. And I try paying with a card directly, a different card than my Apple Pay is attached to, even though I know that one is working fine. And still no go. So I don‚Äôt eat Taco Bell that day. A week or so later I download the app, maybe it will let me pay? No, the app is even worse, because it gave me the payment error the first time I tried to checkout, now it will only show waiting forever, the little ellipsis lighting up instead of a spinner, but still it‚Äôs just sitting there thinking, not doing anything as far as I can tell."
"I go to Taco Bell frequently, so I use the app a ton, almost day to day.  Sometimes the app won‚Äôt add items, won‚Äôt let you submit your order, won‚Äôt let you do this or do that. 
I ordered using the app a few days ago, then yesterday and today I can‚Äôt. Look at their updates and they updated the app two days ago ‚Äúfixing issues‚Äù. Fixing them made it so I can‚Äôt order. I can add items to my cart, it looks like they went to the cart, but if you click on the cart it tells you to go to the menu to start ordering. 
When it works it‚Äôs great but the downtime has literally been 25% at this point. After the first couple times this happens, you‚Äôd have to believe the developers would see this coming and test a bit more, but seems like there isn‚Äôt much testing when these bug fixes come."
"The app seems well designed but what could you possibly need it for? At best it‚Äôs completely pointless; at worst you buy and pay for food they‚Äôre out of. I got this app because the line at lunch time at the Taco Bell near me is over a dozen cars deep. I thought like it every other restaurant app where you tell it you‚Äôre in the parking lot and they bring it to you. But no, you still have to go through the drive through like normal. You just don‚Äôt have to say your order which is nice for the people behind you; but you, yourself, receive no benefit whatsoever. In fact, if you are kind of limiting your options. If you ordered something they don‚Äôt have, you already paid for the food and your ONLY option is to take a substitution. Myself I got a free drink downgrade; paid for a frozen drink but the machine was busted and so I get a regular drink and Taco Bell gets to keep the 60 cents or whatever."
"This app is so spotty that I 95% of the time have to use the website. What‚Äôs the point of having an app if I have to use the website just to place my order? Whether it be loading which location to order from, to simply looking at the menu, to the customization screen freezing, to when I select the customization button I‚Äôm waiting for 1 minute+ just for it to load. Simply ridiculous. The app will crash when attempting to check out, freezes when I‚Äôm trying to select in store or drive thru, and I have to submit my order a few times for it to even go through. All while closing and re-opening the app. It seems to get better with an update, only to go right back to how it was before updating a few days later"
"Twice in the last week I have tried to take advantage of their special offers.   I see the reward in the app but when I comes time to redeem it, I click the REWARD button and I get a ‚Äúwhoops!  Try again later!‚Äù    But curiously enough everything else in the app works.  I can add to my cart and get all the way to checkout but can‚Äôt even apply the reward at the check out screen.  It certainly seems like these ‚Äúreward‚Äù offers are a bait-and-switch to get you to order anyway even if you can‚Äôt apply the offer.  But I have gone elsewhere and have only gotten more frustrated with Taco Bell which will surely decrease my visits in the future.   And then you send a comment to them in the app asking to be contacted and you hear nothing.   It‚Äôs called ‚Äúfast food‚Äù not ‚Äúspend far too much time and frustration with an app that doesn‚Äôt work only to go somewhere else to eat after you‚Äôve wasted a large portion of your lunch hour‚Äù food."
"The app works great for a number of key features:

1. Customization. I can customize just about any item, swapping the protein, adding extra of a topping, adding a nonincluded topping, or removing a topping! It also shows the price for each add-on. 

You can also add sporks, napkins, straws, lids, and an unlimited amount of mild, hot, and fire sauces! 

2. User-Friendliness. The app is easy to use and navigate, with intuitive menu items and navigation features. It offers ready time and options to cancel an order if necessary. Well done! 

3. Multiple Payment Options. I can check out with a credit card, save gift cards, apply split payments, or use Apple Pay.

4. Sophisticated Graphics. You can tell a lot of thought and effort went into building this app. It‚Äôs also great on visuals so you can see exactly what you‚Äôre ordering.  

5. Rewards. Rewards. Rewards. Every 3rd visit I have already accumulated a reward, which is awesome! The Nacho Bell Grande, priced at more than $5 is the best value reward for spending $20. They also offer occasional rewards, double points, or other promotions to try new and hot items.

Great app! Love it!"
"Well, I thought my issue was fixed, but the app won‚Äôt let me log in. I wrote down the password, saved it in the iPhone. But now that I‚Äôm ready to order, my login fails. Why??? Ugh 

üî∑üî∂ Finally an email showed up with a link that did not expire.  If it takes my payment next time I order, it will be terrific. Thanks for the offer to email the app team. I will if it doesn‚Äôt take my payment. üî∂üî∑

üî¥ Still waiting for the reset email mentioned below üî¥

Please help us, developers. I didn‚Äôt remember my password, so I clicked on the link for forgot password. The email promised does not show up. This app used to work well. Now I cannot log out in.  The password reset email does not show up soon. Then it expires. 

Updated review:

Help!  I‚Äôm hungry!  I added items to the Taco Bell app. I chose this method because I want to customize my items (and not try to tell it to the drive up speaker). Got to checkout. No matter what credit card I use, it won‚Äôt go through. So I tried online, even signing up for Visa Pay. But no, my payment method won‚Äôt go through. I wanted Taco Bell food. But evidently Taco Bell wants me to go to McDonalds. 

End of Update

I like using the app to order because of the ease of adding or removing ingredients.  I know that it will be made how I want it. 

Several ways to pay are offered. It's easy to use.  I'd recommend this app if you love Taco Bell."
"You never realize how bad this app is until you go to pick up your food with your friends and you‚Äôre the only person whose order isn‚Äôt there. So you sit there in a confused, mild panic trying to figure out what went wrong in the app. Not only will the app not let me sign in, no matter how many times and different ways I‚Äôve tried to do it, it is also constantly changing locations up on me. Even after I‚Äôve selected the correct location, the app will decide it knows best, and stealthily reset the information. Ultimately, I had to park, go inside, and create/wait/pay for another order. Even when I clicked on my text receipt and tried to find where my order went, it takes me back to the log-in screen that I can‚Äôt do anything at.  And this is not the first time this has happened to me. I order from Taco Bell almost every week with my friends, so I rely on this app pretty frequently. Taco Bell is great, but this app ain‚Äôt."
"I put in an order for pickup for exactly $30. When I checked out with apply pay, the payment went through but the app gave me a famous ‚Äúuh-oh!‚Äù Message, and seemingly didn‚Äôt push the order through. I went to the store, and the owner/operator said he couldn‚Äôt make the order, nor issue a refund. Apple Pay also doesn‚Äôt offer an option for refunds, so I don‚Äôt recommend trying to pay that way through this app. So I had to re-order at the store and pay for my order again, so now I‚Äôm double payed, and I can‚Äôt order the quesorito which is the only reason I try to use this terrible app. And in standard Taco Bell fashion, they messed up over half my order in the drive thru (the cashier/order taker to be specific). A refund would be great, I wouldn‚Äôt expect it though. Please just allow me to order the quesarito through the drive thru again so I don‚Äôt have to keep having payments go out and ‚Äúghost orders‚Äù, nothing in return."
"I‚Äôm an extremely busy person, as many of us are, and I was told that Taco Bell took the only item I order off the menu and the only way to order it is via the app.  The problem is, I try to grab food between cases and don‚Äôt always know when I‚Äôm going to hit a Taco Bell store or what area I‚Äôll be nearby.  It makes my life much more difficult to only allow me to order from the app, and I‚Äôve been stuck in drive though lines for more than 25 minutes before I can even be told I cannot order items.  This does not sound like a great business plan for the future and I‚Äôll be sure to visit competitors that allow me place orders from menu items that still exist in drive throughs."
"So I like to order ahead on the app and then pick up through the mobile lane. I don‚Äôt know if my location is just not good, or if when you order within the app it appears differently for the store employees? I feel like every time I ask for items to be removed, like no lettuce on my child‚Äôs taco for example, every single time it has the lettuce. They have never once removed items when I use the app, so after every order they get a half decent review because the instructions are never followed. When I order in the store or drive up, the items are removed? So I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs a comparability issue between how the store sees the app orders or it‚Äôs a flaw in my location, but it‚Äôs extremely disappointing that without fail, I have to pick lettuce off of tacos when I ask them not to add it every time."
"I continue to use this app, but, every time, I hope there is a better version by the time I use it next. I continue to be disappointed with the app performance and ease of use since its original launch.

Two things:

One:
I should be able to order more than one type of an item. I wanted two beef chalupas and my son wanted two steak chalupas. The shopping cart just adds more of what was already in it. There is no way to check in the cart if the order was correct. After much consternation, I figured it would end up being four steak chalupas even though I had attempted to order two beef and two steak. I was correct when the order was picked up, it was four steak chalupas. This is silly. App developers, I know you‚Äôve had a stressful year, but, c‚Äômon. 

Two:
I was happy a few orders ago to figure out the ‚Äúfavorites‚Äù so I could avoid the usual tedium of the app. But when I attempted to order our favorite, I noticed the order included Fiesta Potatoes. Fiesta potatoes are no longer on the menu. Since the order was a ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù there was no way to modify it in the shopping cart. Really? Please make a ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù amendable in the cart!!

In general, the app is confusing and is trying to be too slick. I suppose the app is great for a single person who orders consistently, but singles are not your only customers!"
"We frequent Taco Bell several times a week. today I go through the drive-through to get my normal order and I‚Äôm told they can‚Äôt provide that food through the drive-through anymore you have to order it in the app and then come back to the drive-through. so I pull in the parking lot, download the app, navigate and after it continues to delete my items after adding. 20 minutes later I‚Äôm finally finished with the app freezing and deleting my items- so not user friendly. I go to check out and there‚Äôs no pick up times available  at the store at all. I called the store to ask and they say ‚Äúsorry there‚Äôs nothing we can do‚Äù. Forget fourth meal- I can‚Äôt get one meal here anymore!"
Using the app was easy. My only issue is that the Taco Bell near my home said they didn‚Äôt see that my order was paid when I told them I‚Äôm pretty sure I paid through the app. I gave them my card anyways since I was going through the drive thru. I left and checked my bank account and I saw I was charged twice. I called and the woman on the phone was rude and said she couldnt help us and to call tomorrow for the store manager. She could have just apologized and said she can not authorize a refund and that we had to call the next day for the store manager. Instead she gave us a tone/attitude like it was our fault and gave us excuses why it‚Äôs not her fault. I don‚Äôt need excuses. I just need to know who can take care of my problem. I feel like there‚Äôs an issue with communication between that location and the app or a training issue.
"It‚Äôs so jumpy and slow it doesn‚Äôt register half the buttons you‚Äôll press and every time I try to pay for my order it can‚Äôt handle it and either says something went wrong or just crashes. I can‚Äôt even try to pay for my order unless I select I want it in the future(great more waiting), then after that it will allow me to pick whether I‚Äôm in the drive-thru or in store pick up, of course it will crash if I click drive-thru so I click in store suddenly the store location changes to some random location miles away, fix that then the app crashes and I have to do it all over. If I somehow get to the point of payment in the app it crashes if I input my card info and I have to start over and of course I can‚Äôt pay cash at the restaurant cause that‚Äôs too hard, visa check out doesn‚Äôt work in the app either. So basically delete the Taco Bell app and download the chipotle app or tell your dog you want a taco, I guarantee it‚Äôll work out way better and less stressful."
"I was going to order food today and instead I‚Äôm sitting in my car writing a review because I can no longer use the app for the customizations I want. No longer can you order sauces on the side? Why remove this option? And you no longer can request your burrito grilled under the ‚Äústyles‚Äù option either. I can live with Taco Bell removing the option to have my burritos grilled if they‚Äôre no longer offering it. However, if I want my sauce on the side I would either have to go into the store or drive thru and order it. Can no longer use the app for the customizations I want. Using the app was convenient and increased my Taco Bell visits. These changes have decreased my visits and I might as well stop going here altogether if Taco Bell can‚Äôt make it as easy as opening up the app and placing an order.

**devs: I mean the sauce in a cup, on the side. Not in the burrito. There used to be an option for this."
"This app is atrocious. It‚Äôs incredibly buggy and broken, not to mention ugly, clunky and difficult to use. Opened it up after a long break and it couldn‚Äôt do anything include get a list of restaurants. Forced quit and it worked. After painfully navigating and adding items to my order I left the app for a few seconds. Came back in and my order was gone. Painfully reordered. Tried to use ApplePay. ApplePay seemed to think it went fine but in the background it displayed what I assume was an error message but it immediately animated off the screen. After multiple attempts I gave up and tried to use my American Express. It gave me some non descriptive error for that. Finally had to use a backup credit card. During all of this the app crashed multiple times including right after successfully placing the order. I made one of the top and most successful apps on the App Store so I know what makes for a good app and this is not it."
"I pulled into a Taco Bell in Monticello on route 17 in New York, upstate. I entered my order in the parking lot, paid, and all seemed good. The app asked when I would pick it up, I said now, and it alerted that it would be ready in 5-8 minutes. It was busy, so that was OK.
I got in and one of the workers asked if I was one name, it was not me, and I told him my name and that I had ordered using the app. 
I waited. And waited. Three parties came in, ordered, and got there orders. I finally got the attention of another employee and asked, and ONLY then did they start to make my order. 
I told them what happened, asked how I was supposed to have interacted and they did not seem to have any idea.
The app may be fine, but the employees do not seem to know what to do. If they do not start an order until you identify yourself and even that messes up then I do not see any reason to use this app versus giving and order to an employee at the register."
"Ordered the new Cheddar Chalupa, soft taco, and some cheesy potatoes all for less than $3!! Loving the app and loving T-Mobile Tuesdays (got hard shell taco for free by being T-Mobile customer)!  Should have made an order through here MONTHS ago!!

That‚Äôs how it started...then I was running late, so had to change my order time. The food wasn‚Äôt being prepared yet, and I could change it earlier so why not now?  I had to cancel my order. I did get a text to re-order, but it‚Äôs vastly misleading because it didn‚Äôt re-order, just brought me back to the taco bell website (not even the app). I also had in that a coupon through T-Mobile for the free taco, and poof! It was gone. Also, he cheesy potatoes that we‚Äôre in my order?? Somehow aren‚Äôt even noted in my canceled order. 

I haven‚Äôt lost all confidence in the app, still great deals in there, but poorly planned. If you go off from a simple order that you can follow through with, you‚Äôre in for trouble right now."
"Every time I try to use this app, something is always malfunctioning. First it was that the order didn‚Äôt get put through to the store, even though I could see it on my end. Even if it does manage to make it to the store, the employees always mess up my order. Now, it ‚Äúcan‚Äôt connect‚Äù to the store I‚Äôm trying to order from. This is a big problem because I like to customize my order and also I like to prepay because sometimes I have friends picking up the order for me. Tried calling the store directly and they told me they don‚Äôt take orders over the phone. So, I wrote down my order for them and what I got was someone else‚Äôs order completely. I really like taco bell but at this point all I‚Äôm doing is spending money to have my order messed up. Also, what‚Äôs the point of ordering in app (other than customizations) if they don‚Äôt start making your order until you check in at the drive through? I shouldn‚Äôt have to wait 15 minutes when I ordered ahead of time."
"You‚Äôre better off just ordering from whatever place you‚Äôre going to. I was initially excited because you can customize your order, but in reality it doesn‚Äôt actually work that way. And I haven‚Äôt made any super crazy super custom orders, just simple stuff like not putting lettuce or rice on something, or making it fresco style. I‚Äôve ordered on the app three times now and every time i get my food it‚Äôs wrong. Three strikes, you‚Äôre out. Also, the last time I went through the window the guy handing me my food asked if I checked the box to make a taco fresco style, or if I had manually entered to take away dairy and add pico de Gallo. I told him I checked the box to make it fresco, and he said that was odd because normally that is a free option but since I did it in the app it charged me. The app had frozen while I was in the drive through and did not reset after a force close or restarting my phone, and now my last order shows in progress. It‚Äôs honestly a mess and I‚Äôm not going to use it again."
"Got the app thinking somehow my experience would be faster and/or easier, but after selecting each item and carefully typing in my credit card info, I was informed I STILL had to wait in the drive thru line before they‚Äôd even start making my order. 
So, exact same amount of time waiting in the drive thru, plus I had to manually enter my credit card info instead of just letting them swipe it at the window. 
If they want people to use the app, there should be SOME benefit, right?

The app itself worked okay. Some glitch resulted in unwanted items showing up in my cart but I caught it before I ordered. Of course it didn‚Äôt matter because I got the wrong items anyway, but that‚Äôs an issue with the store, not the app."
No matter what card I use it always gives me an error on payment. I can never use the app bc of that. It doesn‚Äôt even want to take gift cards when they‚Äôre purchased. I can‚Äôt click on any of my cards to use them they‚Äôre all faded out. I have to add them over & over again to only get the same error messages. It‚Äôs really annoying. And now that potatoes are back it doesn‚Äôt give you the option to add them to items. But it will let you swap the protein for potatoes. Which is really weird. I would love to be able to order on the app & eat there more often but never can bc I get annoyed at having to try to get it to take the payment. Please fix it!
"It takes forever to earn points, i have 104 points & have no joke spent almost $40 so far through appü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I customized an item and paid for purchase, then says it charged me almost $5 less, so when I got to Taco Bell I told them think an error and can they please cancel whatever that was, my order was more expensive than that, I literally JUST customized it, but was gone & instead I got one bean n cheese burrito and that wasn‚Äôt even what was ordering!!!! Taco Bell employee of course said, I had to cancel through app and request refund through app, yet couldn‚Äôt find anywhere to do and was already there. After leaving with my one burrito, I looked at app and couldn‚Äôt even find way to contact anyone! 

Just such a hassle and seems always something, they don‚Äôt have any deals like anywhere else, add earning like zero rewards after all I have spent, just pointless!

Use the McDs app, they have amazing deals every day, all day!"
"There hasn't been a single discount in the ""offers"" section of this app for over a year. 

I mobile ordered breakfast once on a snow day. The store happened to be opening late. I got no notification or contact, so I went to the store. They didn't have any food made yet and ""no money in the drawer, come back later for a refund."" I went back later and the manager REFUSED to refund me or give me the food. She told me to DISPUTE THE CHARGE WITH MY BANK. I demanded the contact information for the district manager, which she gave me. He ""sent me coupons"" which never arrived. He showed me a picture of the returned envelope because he wrote the wrong last name. Then he never resent. I will never trust the Taco Bell in Wyomissing PA again. 

The store at 402 Madison Ave in Reading PA is my local Taco Bell. Regularly, my mobile order never shows up on their screen even 5 whole minutes after marking ""I'm here."" So a team member has to write down my order on a piece of paper. Talk about an awkward experience. It's happened 3 times."
"I have tried to order using this app to pick up in the drive through twice now. I like the ability to be able to customize everything. I make sure my app is up to date...I place my order and use Apple Pay, it charges my card but then doesn‚Äôt actually work!!! Doesn‚Äôt send to the restaurant!!! It took OVER A WEEK to get that money back on my card. This has a huge inconvenience and I reached out to Taco Bell customer service about this but OF COURSE, no response. It just took over a week and the transaction dropped off my bank account. I trust tried to use it again (benefit of the doubt) and it did the SAME EXACT THING AND NOW IM IN THE SAME BOAT. And I‚Äôve never even heard back from customer service about last time ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è honestly unacceptable and makes me avoid Taco Bell a lot more now. Please get your app situated, now is not the time to be holding up people‚Äôs money for over a week because your app needs help."
"How is it that I placed an order ahead of time for pick up at the drive thru and they tell me they don‚Äôt see my order and I have to pay for it with them. Makes zero sense as I already paid! What‚Äôs the point in ordering thru the app if it doesn‚Äôt send my order as intended?? And then when I did receive my food, of course it‚Äôs incorrect. So now they have to start all over again. My goal in using the app is so I can order what I want and it be clear in plain text with no error of not being heard correctly by the order taker. EXTREMELY disappointed, to say the least, with this app. Come‚Äôon Taco Bell.. get with the program! Plenty of other places have their online/mobile ordering a smooth, easy, hassle-free process. This experience was far from that! Oh! And yes, I made sure I ordered at the correct location and visited the correct location. Smh. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"So, I have an IPhone X with a good signal and I consistently have issues with this app. The app is slow and sometimes it seems it‚Äôs frozen, sometimes it eventually works, sometimes I have to back out. It crashes when I check out (I have to delete the app and reinstall and then it works for a little while). The UI seems cluttered. It‚Äôs buggy, the notifications seem random or slow. The offers never work. 
It asks me to update my password and/or signs me out too often which is frustrating cause I have to go through this process when I just want to order my food. So, basically, ordering food on the app has become a chore. I‚Äôm to the point where if it doesn‚Äôt work the first time I say ‚Äúscrew it‚Äù and I just don‚Äôt go. 

The old version of the app with the old UI was so much smoother. So much faster. So much cleaner. I really wish they would roll back to that version. I feel this version of the app is the windows VISTA of the Taco Bell app."
"If I could physically give zero star, I would.

On two different accounts now, the Taco Bell app has forcibly barred me from placing orders to any restaurants. I can at least access the menu and my favorites, but when I go to check out, the error always says ‚Äúno pickup times available, please select another store.‚Äù

Three problems with this: A) that‚Äôs complete nonsense, the store is open and accepting orders, B) I get this error before I can ever select whether I want it inside or drive-thru, and C) this error is present for ANY AND EVERY restaurant I select.
I can‚Äôt place orders any more and there‚Äôs ZERO reason why! It would make sense if the store were actually closed, but I know from previous experience that I *can* place online orders to stores that are unexpectedly closed!
The ONLY thing I‚Äôve seen that fixes it entirely is to create a new account. I only have so many email addresses, which means inevitably I will be locked out entirely.

Thank you *so much* for placing a kill switch on all accounts I can make!
Really appreciate how this app goes above and beyond in destroying customer service and goodwill!!!"
"This is so easy & convenient. I place an order & pay for it on the app while my husband is driving to the store. It‚Äôs ready by the time he gets there. If you don‚Äôt know when you‚Äôll arrive you can place the order, pay for it, & select pick up later. Then all you have to do is check in when you‚Äôre there. I usually check in when I‚Äôm a few minutes away. They make the food fresh so I arrive just as they finish. I hope they have a better loyalty rewards system soon though. I don‚Äôt think they currently have one at all because I haven‚Äôt gotten any rewards, and I‚Äôm always using the app! I‚Äôll keep using it because I love Taco Bell, but I‚Äôm sure others could be incentivized with a loyalty rewards program."
"This is my second chance at letting Taco Bell do it‚Äôs job 
The last couple of times I have been there were horrible. The food was cold it didn‚Äôt taste good it was thrown in a bag and it just wasn‚Äôt good. So I decided today I will try again. I ordered on the app so maybe I could make sure it was right And They forgot my cinnamon twists. I don‚Äôt know why this Taco Bell in Brewton Alabama is so bad. The last timeWe went there was even a girl that was supposed to be on the front register and she was cursing using the F word and we stood at the register for I don‚Äôt know how long before she even decided to come and take our order and then when she did take our order she got it wrong. Something needs to happen at this Taco Bell."
"Overall this is a fairly good app! Love the customization I can do to my orders and how everything is laid out and pretty intuitive. 

Where I have an issue is that the app constantly says ‚Äúooops something went wrong and we are working on it‚Äù. This prevents me from using rewards in the app I have earned from spending money with you and there isn‚Äôt a feature that lets you go back in and scan the receipt to add points to my rewards when the app is working properly. 

It would be fantastic if you could add the ability for us to scan the receipt and get points for the purchases we make while the app is down or if we don‚Äôt have our phone or something. Many fast food apps have this feature and you should too!"
"I don‚Äôt understand how people are having good things to say about this app. After dealing with this last transaction where the app took the money (not the first time) for an order out and then the app goes insane and error message pops up ‚Äúoops sorry something went wrong‚Äù .. of course it goes wrong AFTER my money is gone. It‚Äôs been a few days and I have yet to see my money return in my account. To me it‚Äôs not even worth the time trying to get the 8 bucks back. (I used cash app and did attempt to get my money back but they told me to contact Taco Bell) The app NEVER takes note of your orders and always glitches after you pay. Those are the only issues but seems to be very important factors when dealing with an app that is taking your money. This is a review to purely warn people be mindful when using this app, 50 / 50 shot that‚Äôll your order will actually go through or not. If it doesn‚Äôt, do not expect a refund!"
"The app works ok, however there is one serious flaw- if you go to check out and there is something you in your cart that is unavailable for any reason, it won‚Äôt process.   Not only will it not process, the message saying ‚Äúsomething in the cart is unavailable‚Äù is too ambiguous.  So now you have to play a guessing game as to which item is causing it to hang.   Imagine a large order where you have more than 10 items‚Ä¶ you have to try and guess, and hope you get it right.  So if you do remove the right item, and didn‚Äôt add another substitute you have to do multiple orders.   Or if you get it wrong it could take much longer to order than necessary."
I ordered a nacho box it processed the payment but never gave me an order number or confirmation so I assumed it didn't work and proceeded to login to the app and make the order again with it actually working the second time but when I arrived at the location they said I had two orders but I had no order number for the first one so I try to get a refund for the first one just to be told they couldn't help me. So I call again the following day to see if maybe I can get the order I paid for and they said they can't even if I did pay for it because it should have credited the money back into my account but I'm looking at my bank statement that clearly says I was charged twice. The app is extremely glitchy and I'm an extremely easy going person who never goes out of my way to write reviews but I work for Starbucks and they are beyond accommodating in terms of making the moment right and Taco Bell clearly has no intention of doing that.
"Update:  I was now charged twice using my GC and debit for the full amount.  Since the new update, I can‚Äôt login the app using Facebook.  I logged in fine on the computer.   Come on guys!!!!  Get this together!!!

The app has work decent until today!  I have 3 location favorites saved. I selected the second to place my order. After paying for it, the order was sent to my first favorite location. Thinking I made an error, I cancelled the order and reordered at my second favorite location. Again, the order was sent to my first favorite location. In the past, I had no problem and could select a different location and get my order at the location I selected. Something has happened to the app in the past 2 weeks for my locations to not register. Please fix this ASAP!!!  Until then, I‚Äôm giving one star. I had to repurchase my order and later go to the other location to get a refund after showing proof I had to order at the 2nd location."
"I added items with all of my modifications, and the items randomly disappeared out of my cart. Also sometimes my modifications don‚Äôt ‚Äústick‚Äù either. I selected ‚Äúgrilled‚Äù, and it reflects ‚Äúgrilled‚Äù in the cart, but then I‚Äôll look again and it is mysteriously not there. I added it like 3 times‚Ä¶ if I hadn‚Äôt noticed this glitch, I would have assumed it was the restaurant forgetting to grill my burrito, when in fact the app takes off the modifications for some reason. 

also, there is some type of glitch with finding a location. It won‚Äôt find any locations near me, sometimes (and I have location services enabled). 

One more thing, I had a poor experience at a location months ago, and requested to be contacted. no one ever contacted me. Now i‚Äôm wondering if they ever even got the complaint (another glitch?)"
"The app was pretty decent in that you could ‚Äúwindow shop‚Äù the menu without having to start an order, which makes it superior to at least a third of all drive-thru ordering apps. The rewards are just OK, though the $5 Cravings Box was a good deal for a while. I found that it would fail to process the order if you selected sauces, but I just left them off the order ahead option and just verbally asked for what I wanted at the window. 

Sadly, the app seemingly no longer works with the latest iOS 12 (according to an email from the devs, and contrary to the description here in the App Store) so it has to go into cold storage until I can get a new phone. I‚Äôm not sure why they‚Äôre the only one out of the dozen mobile food apps that doesn‚Äôt support it, but I guess they don‚Äôt want my money."
"This app is so disappointing. The first couple of times I used it, my order was filled no problem. However, I am not exaggerating when I say I have driven to five different Taco Bell locations on ten different days and not one of them will fill my order through the app. The app always says no pickup times available. I have deleted this app because it is simply unusable. I am vegan and when I order at the window it can be embarrassing because I get very specific with my order, so I liked being able to order over the app so I don‚Äôt have to give the team members the trouble of trying to understand my order through the speaker. But now I am doomed to those interactions. Bad bad app."
"Your app is bad and you should feel bad. First, I used a ‚Äúfind my location‚Äù to set the location of the Taco Bell I was literally sitting it, it set the location to one 5 miles away. Second, when ordering I had to open/close the app (hard reset) 2x times before I get actually get the Apple Pay button to activate/work. Third, when I found out I sent my order to the wrong taco bell (not the one I was sitting in) there was no way to contact the Taco Bell to tell them I wasn‚Äôt going to pick up the order. Forth, trying to take advantage of the t-mobile Tuesday coupon is the worst experience-you don‚Äôt know if it applies the coupon or not unless you click on 5 things. What a waste for all parties involved. Fix this crap."
"This app is a source of constant frustration. Even when I can get it to load properly I will experience fun glitches like the app crashing every time I try to check out, adding random items to my cart, deleting all my customized preferences, or it‚Äôll just straight up send my food to a random location 20 minutes away from where I‚Äôm at. And you will never get your money back if you cancel an order that the app decided to send half way across town. I still have 2 canceled orders that haven‚Äôt been refunded. 

I got this app because I am vegetarian and I though it would be easier to customize orders on the app then answer rude question like ‚Äúwell, why don‚Äôt you want meat‚Äù or ‚Äúyou said you DONT want beef, you mean beans right?‚Äù From employees. However about 40% of the time my food still comes with meat on it and the app is just as frustrating as dealing with the employees at my local stores. 

Not worth it at all. Don‚Äôt waste the storage space on your phone."
"This isn‚Äôt just for the app, it‚Äôs for any and ALL online services provided by Taco Bell. Both the app AND their online web page refuses to process any online payment with a debit or credit card. I have contacted all my banks behind each card and they each confirm the issue is with the merchant services only.  non of my cards  are gift cards, no are preloaded cards, just straight debit and/or credit cards. The associates at my local Taco Bell even confirm it is an ongoing issue.  To make matters worse no taco bell location would replicate my order and have me pay at the location citing that the orders can only be made online. So the only options I am given by Taco Bell stores  are to either make a completely different order for far more money, or place my order online, which they confirm I can‚Äôt do since they know the app and web page won‚Äôt accept payments online. Terrible services and company."
"My family likes to use the Taco Bell app to order most of the time. It‚Äôs easier for the kids to see and tell us what they want than looking at the menu at the drive thru. We like the ability to customize our orders, too. However, I don‚Äôt like that we can order items that the restaurant is then not able to make. This has happened multiple times, and they don‚Äôt have the ability to refund the money. Just today we were not able to get our chosen menu items and ended up receiving beef tacos. I do not eat beef for health reasons. We were not informed that this would be the replacement. I know that‚Äôs more of a customer service issue at the drive thru, but it would be so much better if we could have our money refunded or if the app had a feature that alerted the customer to items that are not available."
"This is more about the scummy/scammy practices of the corporation than the app itself, though it‚Äôs not perfect. Every single time I order online, there is some problem at the store and at least one thing isn‚Äôt available. Of course the workers at the local physical store have no ability to refund any thing or do anything that would make sense. And guess what‚ÄîI already paid online! And guess what‚Äîthere‚Äôs no place in the app to just call or report an issue. Like getting my money back, since I had to start all over again and order in person. The app is basically pointless since I have NEVER been able to get what I ordered and why put myself through the ordeal of having a worker trying to sub things out that I‚Äôm not interested in, and cost way less than I already paid? Too bad about those app-only specials‚Äîtoo much risk."
"Let me explain to you At rhinelander. My experience was horrible.  I ordered on app and they yet still messed up with my foods. Secondly your app doesn‚Äôt have special notes included. And let them know that I‚Äôm deaf driver to come and pick it up.  You haven‚Äôt improve the app!! You need to do that so I can tell them what kind of drink I want. To prevent the coronavirus communication! Fix it and I want my money back! You need to add push button for disability for them to know that I‚Äôm coming up!

Updates, at 1:44am you cancelled my food and return the money back without explanation. What‚Äôs real happening here? Is there a reason to improve it? Maybe your app would have been more feature to add on which I asked you last time and still updated the app.  I know I did contacted Taco Bell about 3 months ago.  I expected you to redesign the app.  I‚Äôd love to see new one with what I‚Äôm asking for to avoid all the confusion."
"There used to be a Taco Bell in Farmington Avenue in Hartford, CT. When I was a boy I enjoyed the times between ballet class to hop over there with my sister and get some burritos and tacos. In fact she taught me how to tell time with the clock on the wall at that very same Taco Bell! This APP helps bring my favorite restaurant into my pocket! No longer do I have to wait in lines either in drive-thru or in stores. Being able to schedule a time for my pick up (and adjust it if I‚Äôm running early) is very useful. I also love how they update the app to be both visual stunning, but easy to navigate. The exclusive deals I receive on my orders via the app, is just icing on the cake- if I should say- sour cream on the taco! Outstanding job T-Bell! Or as you are known in my heart T-Bella ü•∞"
"First of all I would like to stress to the employees especially making taco salads to PLEASE DRAIN THE LETTUCE I HAVE TO USE A NAPKIN AND REMOVE THE WATER AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SALAD IF I DON‚ÄôT I END UP WITH MUSH.  Ok about the app I have to reopen the app several times to place an order.  Tired of looking at a circle going round and round just like it is right now as I am writing this review.  When I go to customize an item sometimes the page just will not stop loading which is very annoying so I have to close the app and reopen the app. Other than these issues about the page not displaying it‚Äôs a wonderful app I love being able to customize my food it‚Äôs amazing but with the other problem it takes away from the good part of the app.  I am hoping that they fix this loading the page problem and then they will have an AMAZING app.  ALSO, PLEASE PLEASE DRAIN WATER OUT OF THE LETTUCE."
"First of all, several of their best items are only available in the app now. Which is stupid. Then you go to the bother of using the app, it takes payments, and never sends it to the restaurant. Causing a huge delay annoying everyone behind you you can show them that you have paid, and they tell you the order never came through. Then you have to apply for a refund and order something you didn‚Äôt want and pay with a credit card causing more of a delay. The whole point of an app is to speed things up. So irritating. Don‚Äôt put the most popular items as ‚Äúapp exclusives‚Äù and have a broken app. Yes, updated app. Doesn‚Äôt help. Eating elsewhere. Annoyed."
"I can order ahead on the app, but basically what happens is they don't actually start making the food until you arrive and announce that in the drive through, so then they just tell you to park and wait for your food and then they eventually bring it out the wrong order anyway. Mind you this was not during peak hours, there was only one other customer behind me in line. Why use the app for a WORSE experience than just rolling up to the drive thru?

Update: I got a developer response for this review ""Please let our Customer Care team know about this."" Um, what do you think me writing this review is? You want me to reach out to your customer care team so they can forward me to the Quality Plus team so they can forward me to the Synergistic Integrity team so they can forward me back here? Just make a better app, and stop replying to these reviews with a canned response that doesn't mean anything."
This Taco Bell recognizes that truck drivers are important people they go above and beyond to make sure truck drivers are taken care of a lot of Taco Bell‚Äôs will not wait on truck drivers even if we drive our semi through the drive-through they won‚Äôt wait on us if you walk up they say you have to have a car when you drive your semi through the drive-through then they tell you you‚Äôre too big make up my mind this Taco Bell treats us with a huge amount of respect and I will always give my business to this Taco Bell I will go out of my way just to come and eat here Again I wish more Taco Bell‚Äôs were like this one thank you and have a nice day
"I used this app religiously for years. There were minor issues here and there and occasionally it would be down or not work like it was supposed to. But what has happened now is utterly unacceptable. My account has been locked by some BS password reset screen, I literally can not do anything, and every time I try it takes me to this screen, says it needs to send me a reset email and NEVER DOES. It has been over 2 weeks, I have hit ‚Äúsend email‚Äù over 30 times and not gotten a single email, NOT ONE!! 

To make things even better, the ‚ÄúTaco Bell Care‚Äù online ‚Äúsupport‚Äù is an absolute joke and an incredible embarrassment to customer support. They claimed to have no idea what the issue was, then claimed they had fixed it and removed the block but have not and now are no longer responding or providing any more support. 

Taco Bell should be embarrassed by this pathetic app and their even more pathetic ‚Äúcustomer support‚Äù"
"I initially downloaded the Taco Bell app with promise of savings and good quality Mexican fast food. Color me surprised when the weekly deals turned out to disappear at check out. 5 Dollar Chalupa boxes marked up to 8 dollars before tax, and most recently, a 10 Dollar Taco and Burrito box costing 13 dollars before tax and 15 afterwards! This is unbelievable. While it‚Äôs only a couple dollars - your ‚Äúdeals‚Äù have their prices increased from 30 to 50 percent in check out! And that adds up. Sure, some locations may not participate, but the app hides this hiccup UNTIL check out - by then I‚Äôve spent time curating and perfecting my Taco Bell order. This is deceptive - morally bankrupt even. Where are these charges coming from? Pick up? Staff? That‚Äôs fine - just SAY SO. If you were transparent with the reality of your prices, I might consider recommending the app to someone else. The convenience is nice, but not worth this cravings pack of lies."
"I have tried multiple locations and menu items but I keep getting the message that breakfast isn‚Äôt currently available.  It‚Äôs 6pm and I‚Äôm ordering only tacos and burritos.

(Update:8/27)  I sent an email with the details of the problem and got a very fast response.  However it turned out that the problem was that one of my items was a favorited item that contained potatoes which are only available during breakfast.  So rather than flagging the offending ingredient the app told me that breakfast isn‚Äôt available.  And I should have known this meant ‚Äúno potatoes‚Äù.  I didn‚Äôt even know potatoes had been removed from the dinner menu so how was I to know what ‚Äúbreakfast isn‚Äôt available‚Äù meant?  The app wasn‚Äôt very user friendly or intuitive.  Still, I‚Äôm adding 2 stars for the fast response."
"SUCH a buggy app. I use it more than I‚Äôm proud of and the new one is not much better than the last one in terms of bugs. I get locked out all the time. I haven‚Äôt been able to log in for 3 days now. I uninstalled and re-installed I and had no luck. I went through the process of changing my password and and then tried to use my new password and it would STILL not let me log in, so I gave up. I tried again tonight and it wouldn‚Äôt let me log in with my new password (saved and filled in by my phone). I tried the ‚Äúchange password‚Äù process again and this time the email didn‚Äôt even show up. I tried it four times. I again uninstalled/re-installed and it didn‚Äôt help. I tried logging in with Facebook instead and approved all the on-screen prompts and it just stalled and didn‚Äôt log in. I eventually just started from scratch and signed up using a completely new email and new password and it finally works now. Endlessly frustrating."
"I have used the Taco Bell app with no problems until the update. The other day I went to order my Taco Bell food like usual. Typically when I ordered the order is ready within 10 minutes. This time around when I went to order it said my food was being made so I was on my way to the restaurant. I get to the restaurant it is still being made so I sit at the restaurant and wait for several minutes. Eventually I go up to the counter and ask them about my order and although it says my food is being made, there is no sign of it on there and as far as receiving my order! There was no way to cancel the order like they usually have that option and my credit card had already been charged!So I had my husband at home doing an online order it through the computer since it looks like the app order is still in limbo. I still cannot even cancel the darn order!"
"The app functionality isn‚Äôt as smooth as others.
It also sometimes doubles your order on the order history page, so it appears as if you accidentally placed two orders even in the middle of your current one.

Now, as for their rewards program?
It‚Äôs trash compared to other food chains. 
I‚Äôm just being honest lol
I can get AWESOME food rewards with Wendy‚Äôs or SONIC Drive-In‚Äôs apps. Taco Bell‚Äôs is simplified to medium drinks & their basic menu items like a crunchy taco unless you unlock ‚Äúfire‚Äù, which by the way, requires you to spend an insane amount of money for something better than the basics.

Will be placing this next part on Yelp as well:
My local chain (Huntingdon, TN) has only been open about a month & a half now, & during the first few weeks, they were doing AWESOME.
The food was hot, it was all put together very neatly (not just slapped together), & it hadn‚Äôt been sitting under a heat lamp for a few hours. 

Recently, they‚Äôve been slacking.
Food is a mess when you open it. Toppings coming all out of the tacos, chalupa shell is rock hard & cold, etc. Do BETTER!!
Y‚Äôall charge quite a bit more for your food compared to other chains, so if you want REPEAT CUSTOMERS, I suggest you change this!"
"I tried to order my free food that I received from downloading the app. This was the worst experience I‚Äôve ever had with a fast food app! Thank God the food was free. 
I ordered to pick my food up in store. Once I got there, this particular store only accepted drive thru & delivery. The app should have stated that. The drivethru was super long and they were super slow. I tried to wait, but it was just too long of a wait. I tried to find the option to cancel.... guess what no option to cancel no where in the app! Looked for the number to the store to call and cancel, no number provided in the app üò£ I googled the number and I still couldn‚Äôt reach anyone. I tried to contact taco bell customer service and it only gave me an option to email them. So somebody got some free food because I didn‚Äôt pick it up and couldn‚Äôt cancel it smh. Worst app ever and I‚Äôm deleting it now. I‚Äôll just go through the drive thru if I want some Taco Bell."
"Off the bat the one thing I hope they fix is the logging out of the account they do everytime you use the app. I understand they don‚Äôt want to keep people logged in for safety concerns I‚Äôm sure. But it‚Äôs frustrating to constantly have to log back in and half the time not remembering my password. 
Secondly there are many glitches in the app, it can be very slow at times when trying to add items to your order. Then if a Taco Bell store does not have an item it will notify you that the store has something unavailable and I pressed the ‚Äúremove items from cart‚Äù button and it never removed anything, therefore preventing me from ever placing my order. 
The only reason I‚Äôm giving it two stars is because you can still order Quesaritos on the app which is not possible if you order in person."
"I am not sure if I will continue to use this app. Poor performance, a bad bug that is removing my modifications when I order. And poor design that when upgrading by adding a meat it does not replace the beef. This app is sub par in my professional opinion. Update: This app continues to push me away from one of my favorite restaurants. There is no way this is a 4 star app. Today I tried to order lunch but upon arrival the store said it could not make the meal because they had no chicken. They also said there was nothing they could do to refund me my money and to contact my bank. This is truly pathetic!

Update:  Well I love the food at Taco Bell, but this app experience along with the service you get at Taco Bell when things go wonky with it has cost Taco Bell a long time customer.  Maybe I will be back in a year, but I am tired of doing chargebacks because the system looses orders.  Goodbye Taco Bell I wish you luck.  User be wary!"
"Every time I‚Äôve tried (multiple different days), it clumps 2 of my completely different customized items into 1, and then going in to edit one to fix it, doesn‚Äôt even help any. This app is also pretty bad because you don‚Äôt get the convenience of workers doing things that make your order cheaper than it might be if you didn‚Äôt fully understand the menu or how the restaurant works. This is also all piled onto the fact that ordering through the app doesn‚Äôt mean your food will be ready when you get there, but that we ring it up at the window and, even if we‚Äôre out of something, you‚Äôve still paid money for it and have to call some corporate trash to get a refund, and then you still have to wait on your order.
Corporate TB makes absolutely awful decisions, and pushing this trash app is one of those decisions."
"I love the convenience of ordering ahead, saves me time & I don‚Äôt have to hand someone my card. I also enjoy their online exclusives like the cravings box BUT 
the app is always never working properly. I thought my screen gave out because of how many times I had to press certain buttons till it worked. But even after you get past the constant freezing, slow loading pages, & broken buttons, you finally get to checkout just for it to say ‚Äòone of the items is unavailable‚Äô but will never tell me which item so I can substitute to it. OR it‚Äôll say error with random coding stuff. 

multiple times I was patient enough to go through each substitute to see if I can manually find which item is unavailable but nothing works. We‚Äôve asked each restaurant as well & they always say ‚Äòno we have plenty of that‚Äô. Wack."
"If this thing actually worked who knows maybe I‚Äôd give it a 2 star rating. Taco Bell you guys need to fix your subpar app. I can‚Äôt believe how many times I read session expired just trying to get some food and give you money. Guess I‚Äôll save my money go else where.

Update. I spoke to customer service probably the biggest waste of time I‚Äôve ever been recommended. The message I sent wasn‚Äôt even taken into consideration when responding to my problem. I stated I had an up-to-date phone and deleted and reinstalled the app on two different phone. They responded with check if your phone is up-to-date and then delete the app. What‚Äôs the point of even emailing them if they‚Äôre just going to tell you to do the thing most people would think of. I sent them an email stating how disappointed I was with their response and the best they came back with was that‚Äôs what works lol. Peace out Taco Bell it was a good run."
"The app use to have a deal section that would help its users save money when they would use the app. Taco Bell has not had deals in a really long time. Without the deal section, there is no point to the app. They don't start making your order until you arrive so it doesn't save you time. If you want to change something or cancel your order you can't and you have to contact the corporate office to get your money back. To me the only good thing about the app is being able to customize your order so at least you know it's right when you order it. Now whether they actually make it right is a different story. For me, Taco Bell has take away the best part of the app by doing away with the deal section and I haven't used the app since."
"I installed the app to take a large order for the family (6 people), set up a profile hooked to Facebook, and went about ordering. I filled in everything, clicked on ‚Äúcheckout,‚Äù and the app logged me out and lost the cart. I tried to log back in, but the Facebook interface kept failing. I then created a profile using my email address, re-created the same order, and checked out, entering my credit card information. The app then informed me that it had a problem transmitting my order and gave me an error message. The next day I discovered that my credit card was charged though my order was never transmitted, and there was no way to communicate directly with Taco Bell about my order through the app. I submitted a request through their website but have received no response and now have to dispute the charge with my credit card company. This is the worst shopping experience I have ever had with an app."
"I had high hopes about the Taco Bell app, but always have a hard time using it. I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve tried to use it and given up after getting so many error messages or having it just lock up on me. Especially during checkout, I‚Äôve had issues like not being able to specify drive through or the app not taking my payment. Not to mention navigating to find what you want. That‚Äôs a beast in and of itself. It seems like the menu is broken up and scattered. It‚Äôs tryin. to be extra when it really just needs to be straightforward. I‚Äôm keeping my hopes up for an update to come out and make it a smooth process (take some notes from chick-fil-a‚Äôs mobile ordering app). I also have two Taco Bells fairly close, but apparently it‚Äôs too far to deliver? I was hopeful when I heard that too. It‚Äôs not going to make me stop loving Taco Bell but I was disappointed."
"If I could give no stars I would, the only cool part of the app is that you can edit the already listed items to suit your taste. Outside of that it‚Äôs so slow and buggy sometimes the order will charge you but not go to the restaurant. There‚Äôs also the fact that you can order wait 10 minutes then drive there expecting to just pick up then you sit there for another 15 mins because they never made your food. If you customize anything be ready to sit there explaining each item line by line because they can‚Äôt read. The funny part is even though I did that they still completely messed up my order and forgot half the ingredients and some items. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just the Taco Bell employees are border line incapable or what it is, I‚Äôve worked fast food and ran fast food restaurants it‚Äôs not hard. Whoever is hiring for taco bell near me needs to be fired because it‚Äôs like walking into a special needs class."
"This app used to work just fine, not sure what happened. The last several times I have tried to use it, I order my food on the app and either select for them to make it now or select a specific time. Then when I get to the restaurant at the specified time, I have to wait in line in order to tell the employees that I am there before they begin to work on making my food. If I am still waiting in line and still waiting for my food to be made, what is the point of the app? The last time I was there, I was so frustrated with it, I talked to a manager about it. He told me that the reason my order is not ready or even in the system yet when I get there is because the Taco Bell app has been having a lot of issues and is not very reliable. He said the app is run by a third party and there is nothing Taco Bell can do to fix it. The manager told me that he would recommend not even using the app because it is too unreliable. Disappointing."
"I‚Äôve used this app for forever and never had problems with it. For whatever reason, a month ago all of my points disappeared. I had multiple rewards built up, and they all disappeared. We‚Äôve continued to use the app, after emailing support, and our rewards expired, our points still read as zero, even though we order regularly and get the point count at every order. Now I have even more rewards emails pointing to even more rewards expiring, but no way to use them with the app not working. I‚Äôm disappointed, because it‚Äôs a lot of money spent. It‚Äôs been a few weeks, and I haven‚Äôt even heard back from support so I guess that email was useless. Disappointing. 

The app works, though the restaurants point out its failures, but it does mostly what it‚Äôs supposed to, the reward system is just completely useless."
"Look, TB isn‚Äôt really quality food. It‚Äôs lunchtime, too much drinking, full you up quick and cheap food. It‚Äôs lazy food. 
Sadly, the same mantra applies to the developers of this app. I write about one app review per year. Something wows next or disappoints me so much that I just HAVE to share it. Sadly, this review is the latter. 
D/l the app. Register through FB because EVERYTHING will use FB someday. Set up my order and make it a favorite. Buy it, pick it up and it‚Äôs slick. That worked exactly one time. Now, my favorites applies 5 orders of the same thing in my cart. A $4 meal is now a $20 meal for 5 people. Wanna delete those extras? Nope. Should LS used the McD‚Äôs app I guess. Want to delete your favorites and start over? Nope again. Wanna even SEE your cart to verify the right crap food is in there? Go pound sand. This app should earn zero stars, but I‚Äôll give it a single star because it LOOKS good. It‚Äôs visually appealing and navigation SEEMS to be intuitive. It just doesn‚Äôt actually work."
"I‚Äôve used a lot of these apps and while I could nitpick every one of them, I‚Äôd rather just tell you what‚Äôs most important to me: response time to feedback. 

Whenever something happens at the store, the Burger King/jack in the box apps are the least responsive, you‚Äôll have to play email tag with them for days to weeks and might get nowhere. Jack in the box solution is to go to there stores cause they never just refund your money for a missing item or something wrong, lost out on reward points cause they made a mistake? Too Bad. 

The Wendy‚Äôs app gets you a response in 24 hours, either text/email but you get that feeling that there‚Äôs definitely one person you‚Äôre talking to and not going through a chain of command or a team. Now, what‚Äôs more important to you? Responsiveness when it comes to your money or something dumb, like a button doesn‚Äôt work or the layout doesn‚Äôt look right for you?"
I been using this app for about a year and for the most part it works. My issues are no actual customer support for issues. I made an order and the app had no issues taking my payment but the restaurant had to close early that day. I never received my usual confirmation for picking up my order since I didn‚Äôt. I contacted customer support multiple times and never got a single response back after 2 days. Only after taking a survey did the restaurant manager reply to my survey and sent one email telling me to contact customer support for a refund. I replied saying I did and no one would respond and neither did that manager to my email. I had to initiate a charge back with my credit card company to get my refund. I was also making a lunch order in advance and after the customization the app decided to completely clear my order because it turned 10:22 AM and breakfast orders can‚Äôt be made anymore and the menu turns to lunch and why is breakfast cut for mobile ordering at 10:22 AM when the restaurant will take it until 10:30 AM? What‚Äôs up with the digital frosty key tag? I bought the physical one and it says I can use it with ANY purchase but the digital one it can NOT be used with any other offers that‚Äôs a scam. I definitely will not be visiting Wendy‚Äôs as much this year!
"For the love of god, if another food company comes out with a terrible app that they tasked an intern and a budget of $50 with to make, I‚Äôm gonna stop eating food all together. 
Your app makes the entire ordering process take longer, more frustrating, and I see zero advantages over ordering in person. If you close out a sign in dialog you must force close the app to ever have the chance to log in. The coupon process is NOT intuitive to apply.. which is crazy, because he internet has done coupons since the start, and we got it down at least 20 years ago. Just delete the app, because I know I won‚Äôt ever try it again, it only wastes time, and when it does work, I never save time. Not once. Never once. Seriously. The speed for me to read out my order into the speaker is greater than opening the app, praying you‚Äôre still signed in, praying it will let you sign back in, praying that the cart functionality won‚Äôt break requiring you to restart, praying the app doesn‚Äôt randomly close. After all that you get the ‚Äúprivilege‚Äù of not having to speak your order.. but I‚Äôm pretty sure searching through navigational menus just to find a specific item, spend time going through to customize it, and repeat for every single item in your order is not as fast as saying ‚Äúnumber 6, no ketchup‚Äù"
"I ordered through their app and when I got to the restaurant, I was unable to check in. I kept getting an error message. I went to the front to ask them to prepare my order and to report the issue. The worker rudely stated that she couldn‚Äôt help me and called for the next customer while I was standing there. I was then told that I had to place the order with them directly and pay again. When I mentioned that I would need a refund for the mobile app order, they stated that I had to contact Wendy‚Äôs customer service for the refund and that they had nothing to do with the mobile app order. I decided to leave the restaurant and get nothing because I found them to be rude and unhelpful. When I contacted Wendy‚Äôs customer service, they told me that the manager at the store would have had to refund me and that they cannot give refunds to customers. They sent a message to the manager at the location and stated that they will contact me when they can. What does that mean? Who refunds customers when the mobile app decides to mess up. The store or Wendy‚Äôs customer service? Regardless I‚Äôm going to contact my credit card company to reverse the charge. I‚Äôve never had this issue with any other food ordering app and I promptly deleted Wendy‚Äôs app and won‚Äôt be using it again."
"So far the app works really well, it‚Äôs does what a mobile ordering app should do compared to some of the other ones out there, however I have to draw the line at the intensive use of my phones location services.  It‚Äôs not that I typically mind if a restaurant uses it to make ordering an easier task, my issue stems from the fact that if I have location services enabled ‚Äúonly when using the app‚Äù that unless I force close it the app will almost flagrantly shove in my face that it is still using my location services because at the top of my screen it‚Äôll show the blue gps line at the top of my screen. I don‚Äôt usually make a habit of force closing my apps which is on me but I figure it would stop on its own given that my settings only allow for when Im ‚Äúusing the app‚Äù and Im not. It does not and It then proceeds to drain my battery and it feels a little sketchy that Im not actively using the app but your actively taking my location, even if the logical conclusion is your using it to suggest nearby restaurants. I have since changed my settings to never use my location, and hope this gets fixed in the future."
"I used this app before today to get free delivery and waited then 30 mins later it said it was canceled.  Nice when kids are all waiting to eat lunch.  No explaination‚Ä¶only that it was canceled.  Called the store and they said it was canceled and blamed it on DoorDash yet I didn‚Äôt get it from doordash‚Äôs app I got it from Wendy‚Äôs app.  
Then today when trying to order my prior order and it never saved on app so I put my order in the cart randomly getting these little pop up errors (‚ÄúError We're sorry, an error was detected.‚Äù  when just going into food to edit or add, just viewing items in cart, etc.  So I decided to favorite each meal plus the whole order just to ensure I didn‚Äôt lose my order.  Then I go to add one more thing, then it cleared my entire order (6 different meals).  I went under favorites to see if they were there and nothing is there.  Ugh this thing is a pain.  Not sure how it got such good reviews.

Two more things to find menu then location and it was just spinning where it had their little food image on the screen with the bar going across repeatedly.  Also, tried to scan the item I bought and system just hung again with the little food image and bar.  It wasn‚Äôt my WiFi that was the problem either."
"I have apps for all the fast food restaurants in my area and this is the absolute worst. 
The first time I used this app I placed my order and paid and when I arrived to the restaurant to pick up my order they told me they don‚Äôt accept mobile orders. How?? Get yourself together Wendy‚Äôs. Obviously if a location is not taking mobile orders I should not have been able to place a mobile order for that location. Fortunately the staff were kind and understanding and I was able to get my meal without having to pay twice. 
Since then, I‚Äôve been able to use this app successfully only one time. Every other time there have been errors that occur and prevent me from checking out. Today there was an offer for a free frosty with mobile order but again, the stupid app will not let me place a mobile order. I just used one of my other apps that actually work and went to a different place to eat. 
I love Wendy‚Äôs but whoever they have got to develop this app needs to be replaced ASAP. I can‚Äôt be the only one they‚Äôre losing business from. 
The only positive thing I can say is that when the app actually works it is simple to use, but I could say that for literally any other restaurant. Step it up devs."
"The app isn‚Äôt showing any stores around and after restarting the app. I just created an account and have not been able to use the offers that I installed it for. There are also apparently no Wendy‚Äôs in my area that are available for mobile ordering, so I can‚Äôt use the mobile deals either way‚Ä¶ Reporting feedback in the app is also NOT user friendly. When I try it insists that I have to choose a time of visit and a store, but NO stores come up. So I can‚Äôt submit the form to give feedback. I just have to wait for whenever the app pops up to ask for feedback, which I haven‚Äôt seen since I first opened the app and handnt even used it yet‚Ä¶ why would they even ask for feedback at that point. üôÑ It‚Äôs been giving me ‚ÄúSorry, there was an error detected.‚Äù Which gives no confirmation that the error was reported or option to fix it. Then when I try to chat, it says I‚Äôm #1 in line, forever‚Ä¶
As a last resort, I logged out and deleted the app and tried again. It then wouldn‚Äôt even let me log in, giving the same ‚ÄúSorry, there was an error detected‚Äù message. I give up. All other apps of all sorts, including Wendy‚Äôs competitors work fine."
"I love Wendy‚Äôs because the French fries are the best, love the 4 for $4, love the free junior frosty with the card I purchase once a year ( I buy one for my adult son too).  I love the senior discount ( or free senior drink) and the apple pecan salad is great. I also love the grilled go wrap. I guess you could say, I love Wendy‚Äôs. As for the staff, they are always nice.  I usually eat at Wendy‚Äôs twice a week, but have been there more often than that many times.    Since you updated the app a while back, MY IPHONE 6 WILL NOT ACCEPT THE NEW APP!  I know it says that I can use an older version, but it just won‚Äôt work!!!  I NEED HELP!  I haven‚Äôt had my Wendy‚Äôs app for months!   Hoping someone will help me. I have points that I cannot access and offers l cannot see.  I haven‚Äôt found a place that says ‚ÄúCONTACT US‚Äù. People who work there don‚Äôt know how to fix this either.  Management, PLEASE HELP"
"So after waiting in the drive through line for over 45 minutes I was finally able to place my order. Then when I attempted to pay, using the mobile app, it took 10 minutes just for the attendant at the window to know how to take payment from a customer using the mobile app. The transaction failed. Apparently I needed to add funds to my Wendy account. I selected $25 dollars and then was promoted to enter my CVV number. When I did it generated an unknown error. I closed the app and restarted my phone but still had the same error. I checked my checking account balance and there was plenty to cover the charge. I called my bank and the agent said everything was good on the banks end. At this point it was clearly an issue with the Wendy‚Äôs APP. I tried the live chat option inside the app. Even though I was 1st in line to chat with a support agent I waited nearly 20 minutes but no agent ever responded to my request. I called the toll free support phone number, was told I was 5th in line but after 25 minutes I gave up. I tried their Instagram chat, it‚Äôs been 30 minutes and no response. Your APP and customer support are total crap!!"
"I think this app is too complicated for the average person to use.   I tried to buy a digital frosty key tag today. First I couldn‚Äôt find the offer. Then I finally found it with two options, physical card or digital. Sounds great!  However when I checked out with the digital option, I still had to go to a store to pick up the physical card. At least that‚Äôs what my store told me when I called to get them to release the digital order. They had never heard of digital key tags. Come on, Wendy‚Äôs, don‚Äôt roll stuff out without training your staff!  You need to let the digital key tag frosty offer work in addition to other deals too. Throw us a bone here! The jr frosty isn‚Äôt the deal, it should be lagniappe.  

Anyway, to anyone reading this, you have to get and use this app so Wendy‚Äôs will continue to invest in it. The app idea is good, the food hits the spot, and the deals in app bring me when I‚Äôm considering the options.  They just need to simplify it. Maybe try some more focus groups and watch people try to use it."
I ordered on the app weeks ago and was charged almost 50 dollars for it all. Never received my drinks and didn‚Äôt get a refund for it so I had to call customer service. I sent an email and waited 4 days still haven‚Äôt heard anything back from them at that point. I grew really impatient and so I tried calling them on the phone and waited about a half hour on the phone to get in contact with someone. The guy apologized and gave me a refund for the entire order but still I will not be using the app again. When I went to the location near me they said they can not scan the free rewards and have to punch them in as a coupon. I had 500 points In rewards I‚Äôm not even able to use because I selected breakfast items and every time I try to place an order to get it they don‚Äôt have the breakfast. Breakfast should be served until 12. It‚Äôs ridiculous and the app is useless. I will be uninstalling. This app is such a inconvenience to use and not worth it. Especially when the food is mediocre. I will not be returning to Wendy‚Äôs and purchasing from them again. Every time I go I am always unsatisfied with their service.
"This app is progressively plagued with issues. It continues to become less user friendly each time it‚Äôs redesigned. Recently, it stopped clearing out the current order after it was placed and the app closed, preventing a new order from being placed the next time the app was opened. Also more recently, selecting an available offer would make it disappear from availability without adding it to the cart. Yesterday, I was unable to process any orders at all. The app froze loading my total each time. Today, after updating the app, I was logged out and the app gives an error message ‚Äúforbidden‚Äù when I try logging in, of trying to sign up fresh. Live Chat with customer service doesn‚Äôt exist anymore and there‚Äôs no email option. I don‚Äôt want to spend who knows how long it will take trying to reach someone over the phone, only to be told they can‚Äôt do anything anyway. 

I‚Äôve now deleted this useless app. Fortunately, I have both a Carl‚Äôs Jr. and a Jack in the Box within a block of this Wendy‚Äôs, so I‚Äôll take my business there a few times a week. Oh, also the Burger King I have closer to home. All those apps are working just fine!"
"We are retired and while at first it was difficult to get used to mobile ordering, we embraced it because of the good mobile offers and pandemic, necessitating drive-thru drive service.  Then they messed up the app so badly that a mobile offer couldn't be added to a mobile order and they were unwilling to help at the restaurant.  They almost lost us as costumers with that debacle, but we left without purchasing a couple of times and eventually an update fixed it.  Again we continued to frequent Wendy's at least once a week for their 2/$5 Single and spicy chicken sandwich deal, or any one of the good app offers they always had.  Now the good offers are completely gone in favor of a vastly inferior REWARDS program, and so are we.  There are many other fast food options out there that want out business and offer discounts that we will use.  The selection of coupons at this time is an absolute joke.  Bring back offers that people want or you won't have a business before long.  The so is useless if you don't offer deals that people want."
"So I went to give this app a second chance today, and it asked me to allow it to always view my location. I never do this because I like to have at least some privacy these days, but I allowed it just this once, figuring if the app knows where I am then it‚Äôs less likely to get confused, right? Wrong. 
Shortly after submitting my order, I go to turn on my car to go pick it up and it won‚Äôt start, so I need to cancel my order that I can no longer pick up. Well, I open the app again to find that it believes I‚Äôm currently IN THE PARKING LOT of a store on the OTHER SIDE OF THE STATE. It then marks my order as completed and picked up, and charges my card. To make things even worse, there‚Äôs no ‚Äúreport a problem with this order‚Äù button like a functional app should have, so I have to wait forever in a customer service queue to get refunded for this order I never got, while figuring out what else to do for lunch, while trying to figure out what‚Äôs wrong with my car. 

Tl;dr this app STILL doesn‚Äôt work after all these months, which can make for a really bad day. Just stick with McDonald‚Äôs."
"In the past 3 years I have yet to have a ""good"" experience at any Wendy's. It makes me sad because I usually enjoy their food. They got rid of their artisan egg sandwich for breakfast. They got rid of breakfast as an option at most restaurants. They got rid of my favorite salad. Not much reason to go. I decided to try the app for the free spicy nuggets. I ordered for pickup through drive thru, and chose the one-time card payment (that doesn't save your card info). My app said PAID. When I got there, they said I needed to add money to the digital balance. While this was an option when paying, I didn't choose it. The app clearly said paid, although I got no email or any confirmation saying I paid or ordered. They were absolutely positive that I had not paid, when I indeed had. So they gave up and said they'll pay for me. Whatever. When I get back and check my bank account, there is the charge for my meal. So I was being hopeful that I actually got a free meal when, nope, they disappointed again. I'll probably be back in a year or so only to disappoint myself again. Long story short, don't bother with the mobile ordering."
"Not the most intuitive app I‚Äôve seen. But what really annoys me is having to place my order and arrive at the restaurant eight minutes before breakfast ends. This is fast food. I don‚Äôt mind if it takes them a little while to prepare it because I know that they‚Äôre new to breakfast, but I should be able to place my order and arrive at Wendy‚Äôs before the cut off and still get it. I wasn‚Äôt able to get there eight minutes early last time although I could‚Äôve gotten there five minutes early. Ended up going to Chick-fil-A. Arrive there at 10:26 and placed my order at that same time and got my order by 10:28 with no problems. Wendy‚Äôs food is good, but the service and app needs improvement. Update: I tried again the next day at an earlier time so I could make sure to use one of the discount codes since it was the last day it was valid. However instead of taking two dollars off my breakfast combo like it explicitly said it would, it would only take off $1.39 no matter what I tried. I did not edit the order or do anything to change the basic elements of the combo. This feels kind of like a scam."
"Dear sir (s) I would like to speak about the new changes you have included in the Wendy‚Äôs app. I‚Äôm not a favorite of the mobile pay app. It‚Äôs Incredibly easy to hack. Not just yours  mind you but all of them. Five family members accounts were hacked. Money stolen and had to get new cards from their backs. This isn‚Äôt only in CA but three different states. I also our choices of meal discounts are dwindling. More app only deals have taken over. We don‚Äôt want delivery meals, when we‚Äôre out we like a sit down experience. Apparently our choices on your app will be severely limited, or completely go to mobile order only. That, will limit our Wendy‚Äôs experience tremendously. Sorry, I know the mobile app is the new ‚Äúhot idea‚Äù to drum up new business. But in our case it will do just the opposite. Good luck we do love Wendy‚Äôs ‚Äúfresh‚Äù menu and freshly prepared meals (hot) hopefully our type of business won‚Äôt be excluded."
"I added money to the app so I can place my order, pay for it, and someone to pick it up since I got hurt. I placed the order and paid in the app with the $50 I put in there. My cousin went to pick it up for me and was told the payment did not went through. I told her the payment number for the app and it didn‚Äôt went through. I had to send the money to my cousin in order to repay for food already paid in the app. This happened two more times. After the second time I chatted with an agent whom saw that everything was correct on my end and sent the information and proof to management of my local Wendy‚Äôs. I was told to delete the app and reinstall it. I decided to try it a few days later to see if it worked and still did the same thing. I was checking my email constantly to see if Wendy‚Äôs management figured out the problem and no response. So now I just preorder or order at the drive thru still with my money just sitting in the app."
"I have used this app about ten times now and have only actually succeeded once. It works to find stores, look at menus, etc, but DO NOT upload a gift card! I have had two gift cards now that I have uploaded and the second it is uploaded to your app, the card becomes invalid. You can no longer use the physical card, nor can you mobile pay or place a mobile order. The app also does not tell you that your payment (with said gift card) failed, so while you wait for your mobile order, thinking everything went through just fine, it isn‚Äôt even being made, bc the restaurant received an order with failed payment. Luckily the employees tend to be very helpful and apologetic, but this app really needs to be fixed. Also, if you add a reward to a mobile order that fails, you do not get the reward back to try again with different payment or to try to use in store instead of on a mobile order. This app is so frustrating."
The app has consistently improved. I would suggest allowing for drink customization such as lite or no ice. It would save me the trouble of having to ask when arriving for pickup and hope they didn‚Äôt already prepare the drink. It would also be great if the credit card CCV would save so we don‚Äôt have to keep entering all the time since I have sometimes left the card at home while trying to order with my default payment. One last suggestion would be to allow us to use whatever balance remains on a Wendy‚Äôs gift card. If you don‚Äôt have enough to cover the entire purchase it does not allow you to split the payment allowing for the gift card to be used up
"I liked the app until they went with the rewards program. I did delivery some. The last order was wrong and items were missing. There was no place on the app to report problems. I did send an email, but didn't receive a response. I had built up substantial rewards and decided to take advantage to purchase a salad. However, the reward points show it was to be used for a salad, but then it couldn't be applied at checkout. So the points were lost in limbo. Today I was in the mood for one of their burgers I really like. I did a pick up at the drive up. It took me 10 to 15 minutes to get there. At the order station I was told it was ready and to pull forward. There were a few cars ahead of me. Once at the pick up window I still had to wait as if I had just placed the order. Definitely no advantage to having used the app and ordering ahead. Has definitely soured me from using the app or even going there anymore."
"I appreciate Wendy‚Äôs effort to bring a mobile app to the consumers. It has been an upgrade to their service. However, ever since the start, the app has been filled with glitches. At the beginning they were mostly minor issues. For the last 12 months, I‚Äôve noticed major issues that drastically altered the purchasing process. 12 months ago, it was issues with pick up options. 6 month ago it was issues with the redemption of offer and reward. A few months ago, they had issues with service speed. It seemed like the store does not get the order ahead, and only starting making the food after the guest has physically arrived today, even when they are not busy. As of today, there is a network issue and the app can‚Äôt send the order in. I had to go to the fast food place next door. Just wanted future guests of Wendy‚Äôs know to check the app and plan ahead before it‚Äôs too late in case they have an ongoing glitch."
"Wow, I order via mobile for so many restaurants but will never do so again with this app.  Placed a mobile
Order for inside pickup.  When I arrived, parked in the designated spot and d I was there.  The app told me to go to the counter and pick up the order.  Unfortunately the restaurant had a sign on the door that they were drive thru only.  I called the restaurant and they told me to get in the very long double drive thru line.  I did not have time to do that which is why I ordered for mobile pickup.  Since I had paid already, I asked the order be cancelled and I tried to call customer service.  After waiting on hold for almost 20 minutes I emailed them and have yet to hear back. I completely understand staffing issues, but the app should be as smart as all of the others out there and not allow me to place the order for pick up inside. Wendy‚Äôs, I expect better from you.  Do not recommend this app!"
"If you are willing to spend quite a bit of time fighting an app to order and pay for your food, then this should meet your needs; otherwise, it‚Äôs a painful experience.  I gave it 2 stars because you can get an order to go through if you persevere!  The fact that it requires you to load funds into your account in order to pay means you have ‚Äúdead funds‚Äù sitting there and cannot access them without adding funds.  The app doesn‚Äôt accept Apple Pay, and, when you FINALLY get an order submitted, your reward at the restaurant is generally a disappointment of a super thin sliced lousy tomato (was it really there?!), a partial ring or two of thin sliced onion, a partial lettuce leaf to go with a reheated burger patty and reheated fries!  I have fond memories of Wendy‚Äôs, and, once in a while, nostalgia and hunger overtake my better judgment.  I hope it‚Äôs a long time until I make the mistake of going to Wendy‚Äôs again! üò©"
"I have no idea if the app is good or not because apparently there isn‚Äôt a password that‚Äôs good enough for me to use to order fast food. I tried so many crazy passwords and each time fulfilled all of the listed requirements, double and triple checked to make sure I had everything required and each time was told what I chose wouldn‚Äôt work. So that‚Äôs why this app is ‚Äúworthless‚Äù to me because I literally cannot use it. I‚Äôve tried contacting them, no response, I tried deleting the app and downloading it again, and nothing has worked so far. Several of the closest Wendy‚Äôs to me are only taking mobile orders because of staffing issues so this app being completely useless has kept me from eating at Wendy‚Äôs for months. It‚Äôs frustrating and the only reason I‚Äôm writing this review is in hopes that maybe, just maybe someone with the company will read it and contact me or resolve the issue, but seeing as how I‚Äôve e-mailed them several times with no response I highly doubt it."
"The app unexpectedly quits! Yep, after the last update, the app starts up, then flashes the Wendy‚Äôs ads (it‚Äôs good at doing that tho) then quits back to the main iPhone home screen. I‚Äôve got tons of free available memory and space and no other apps running at the time. The only workaround I‚Äôve found was to shut down and reboot the phone, then wait,‚Ä¶a while‚Ä¶, and try again to navigate back to the spot I was just in. Hyper annoying when the app unexpectedly quits and you‚Äôre suddenly cold caught on the spot having to shut down and reboot your phone while drivers behind you start laying on their horn while you‚Äôre struggling with the app at the Drive-Thru Speaker is Definitely cringe tier! When you guys put out your next update please fix this. Having the app give up on you when you need it the most makes it cringe worthy and lame."
"Customizing items is incredibly difficult, and there is no option to customize drinks (do you want no ice? Too bad.). There are coupons available solely through the mobile app, but those aren‚Äôt the same coupons that are available in the mailers, so don‚Äôt get too attached to the physical coupon you have. They don‚Äôt start processing the order until you get to the drive through window, so if you have a slow location, you won‚Äôt save any time. But the one benefit: you can pay wirelessly, so you don‚Äôt have to hand over your card.
EDIT: Docking a star because ever since viewing the breakfast menu one time, I can no longer see anything BUT the breakfast menu, at any time of day. My favorites are thankfully still there, but that‚Äôs all I can add from the lunch menu. Perhaps reinstalling will fix it, but I honestly don‚Äôt think the app is worth it, especially when it‚Äôs deals are so much worse than the mailer ones."
"Anecdotally, while I used to run into bugs semi-frequently, it now feels more stable than previous versions. The app itself is decent, but could use some improvements:

1) Lacks Apple Pay support
Not only is this a huge inconvenience factor, but for me, the biggest appeal of Apple Pay is security. With Apple Pay, I don‚Äôt have to give out my credit card number to 3rd parties and worry that they‚Äôll get hacked. Also, the Apple Pay double cash back for Apple Card users does influence where I order more frequently. 

2) UX for Offers 
When applying an offer, it would be more convenient if the app automatically combined the process of adding the offer together with the process for ordering items related to the offer. For example, if the offer is ‚Äú$1 off large fries‚Äù, adding the offer should be combined with the step of adding the large fries to the order (and also the opportunity to customize). The mobile ordering experience has to be as streamlined as possible, or else you risk having it feel like an inconvenience, when you are actually trying to make it more convenient. 

3) Sign In with Apple
Not as important as Apple Pay, but definitely another major convenience for Apple users. Saves me the hassle of having to create new accounts."
"I used to order through the app with no issues but the past 2 times I ordered the order got cancelled and it charged me!!!! The first time I ordered but it glitched out when I clicked check out so I ordered again and it did the same thing. I didn‚Äôt think much of it but then I checked my bank statement and I got charged TWICE without receiving food. I contacted customer service multiple times in multiple ways with NO response.  I ordered again today thinking it was just a glitch and it wouldn‚Äôt happen again, I was wrong. I ordered but then I realized I ordered at the wrong location so I simply edited my order and changed the location. This time I got my food and had no issues with that but then when I checked my bank statement I realized I got charged TWICE! Mind you these 2 times were about a month apart. You‚Äôd think they‚Äôd fix the problem but apparently they didn‚Äôt. Is this even legal?? Seriously they have the worst customer service ever."
"I generally like to use mobile ordering because it allows me to look at the menu with any pressure of the employee in the drive through window or other patrons waiting on me and I can confirm the accuracy of my order. Especially with the pandemic, it‚Äôs been great. This app paired with Wendy‚Äôs seeming to put more effort into the quality of their food in the past year has made Wendy‚Äôs one of our go-to places for takeout. Recently, I have been getting repeated emails telling me I never finished placing an order. This seems to occur the morning following my last mobile order. I open the app, and see nothing waiting to be submitted in my bag. This appears to be a glitch on Wendy‚Äôs end, and while not a huge deal, it is a minor annoyance."
"I‚Äôm not the type to leave reviews but this app has been completely useless and a huge waste of my time. I first started by trying to simply order breakfast. I added my items and got the check out page where it got stuck in an endless loop of loading my pickup method and payment method, would not show my total and would not let me checkout. I completely reinstalled the app, tried wifi and cellular data, still nothing. I thought okay I‚Äôll just try to use one of the discount offers at the restaurant. Can‚Äôt forget to mention the discount offers are hidden in the rewards store, as compared to other apps that feature them on the front page. I get to the restaurant and conveniently the app shows that there are suddenly no offers available even though there were plenty 10 minutes ago when I was looking from my house. Again, reinstalled, tried both wifi and data, still no offers showed up. USELESS!"
"This app is probably one of the worst restaurant apps out there. I had it for about a year and it was manageable at first, but then the issues came rolling in. First is a complete disconnect between the app and the store locations. A few times I ordered ‚Äúin store pickup‚Äù because the app said it was available, but when I arrived the doors were locked and angry employees yelled at me for a mistake the app made (customer service is so shoddy at Wendy‚Äôs but that‚Äôs a different topic). Then came the coupon offers. Sometimes I couldn‚Äôt redeem them but the times that I could, it wouldn‚Äôt apply at checkout. Frustrating when the app sends you notifications about these offers but doesn‚Äôt let you use them. The final nail in the coffin was when it logged me out and when I tried to log in again it said my account didn‚Äôt exist. Bottom line, don‚Äôt touch this app with a ten foot pole, there are better places to eat anyways."
This is by worse app / company ever dealt with and it‚Äôs sad because there food is great the people in the restaurants are very rude especially during covid times... then when trying to send in a formal complaint the customer service constantly hangs up on you. Had to use the rewards and it does not state when using rewards you have to make a purchase well yea the employees tell you that you have to make a purchase because the rewards are like a coupon but it does not state it on the coupon and because they uploaded it into the system they said I‚Äôm not getting my rewards back this is upsetting as a company they are vary unprofessional especially the employees who work for the company countless times they are rude to so many people and no one can complain because once you call to complain they hang up on you. Extremely!!!!!! Disappointed!!!!!!!!! ESPECIALLY with the app as well don‚Äôt recommend it to no one save the trouble !
"First - why can‚Äôt I store my payment method in the app like everyone else allows?  I mean, you can sorta store it, but it wants the CVV number everytime you place an order.  

Second - the app apparently isn‚Äôt in tune with what‚Äôs available at the store.  I placed an order for a burger and a side of chili.  The order went thru and my card was charged immediately.  I get to the window to be told they were out of chili.  I asked them how they were going to handle this, as I had already been charged.  They told me they would take it off the order and credit my card.  I had my doubts, but they must know, right?  Well, it‚Äôs been well over a week and of course, no credit.  I checked the app just to see if the credit was there.  No credit.  
 
App has potential, but needs some work.  Perhaps the developers should actually try it on their way home tonight."
"I‚Äôve been using the app without issues. Grandkids love Wendy‚Äôs so it was nice to have it delivered to them during quarantine or preorder and have it brought to the car. 
I don‚Äôt like the idea of my debit card being saved on the app and , at the time, they didn‚Äôt have Apple Pay, so I had money loaded to Wendy‚Äôs app.  Everything was great. I had a ton of reward points that I could never redeem and a little less than $20 in the app for paying. 
On 2/15 I opened the app to place an order and EVERYTHING IS GONE! Idk if they updated the app or what but it was treating me like we‚Äôd just met. Forgotten was the 1-2 x‚Äôs weekly use. I felt like I had been pretty faithful over the last couple of years. I didn‚Äôt use any other ff apps. And how am I treated? Swipe left, you never existed. 
And yes. I feel as though this is a bad breakup. Wendy‚Äôs cs disconnects me. No response to text or emails. And took my money. How do I prove there was still a balance when they deleted my account? 
That‚Äôs a pretty poorly thought out update. Or is it? I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm not the only one so I guess they made out with the money they stole. 
Idc about the reward points since they were impossible to redeem anyway. But TAKING MY MONEY IS A WHOLE LOT DIFFERENT!
You won‚Äôt be seeing me in their drive through again that‚Äôs for sure. Even if they didn‚Äôt finally add Apple Pay."
"On Friday I put an order for pick-up in on the app. First the reward did not work causing me to be charged full price for an item that was supposed to be $1. Second when I got to the Wendy‚Äôs #9078 to pick up my order they were closed. I went to the drive-thru window and was cursed at by the worker to get out of the drive-thru, the manager then came over and said there was nothing they could do about it and to contact the app for a refund. I attempted to chat with customer service on the app to no answer, called the phone number on the app to no answer, sent an email to no answer as of three days later. Luckily my credit card company was able to cancel the transaction due to the fraudulent service. I will never use the Wendy‚Äôs app again nor go to a Wendy‚Äôs restaurant again. If Dave Thomas knew about the lack of quality of service from what has become of his company he would be rolling over in his grave."
"So I used to use this app all the time and it was awesome. I know some folks had trouble but it worked spectacular for me; until the last update screwed this app up so bad you can‚Äôt use it; and I have no intention of ever doing so for anything more than removing my card, should I ever be able to log on again. Was placing an order; finished and went to cart; boom app crashes. Get it to reload, it shows 3 items in cart, but when you click on it, it wants to submit it, but will not let me see or review any item. I have no idea what‚Äôs being ordered. So I delete and reinstall; now my password and log in doesn‚Äôt work, even though it‚Äôs thumb print enabled and it‚Äôs saved to my phone!!!! Try reset password, emails never come. Call support; I got better luck going on a vacation with the Easter bunny, then I do getting off hold there. So I finally got on removed my card, and that‚Äôs it for me."
"I created a mobile order with the app, entered my credit card information and placed the order. When I got to the drive through window to pick up my order, I was told that they have no record off my order. I showed the manager the pending Wendy‚Äôs charge on my cre‚Äùdit card activity on my phone. She just shrugged and repeated that they had no order, so I left without the food that i had ordered and paid for. My order history on the app also does not show the order at all, so I‚Äôm 100% sure I did not inadvertently place the order at another store. However, but my card was charged. I don‚Äôt have the time to  spend talking with Wendy‚Äôs Customer Service to try and get a $6.50 refund, so in future I‚Äôll just avoid both Wendy‚Äôs and their app. I would definitely recommend steering well clear of Wendy‚Äôs app which has not been fully tested and is not ready for prime time."
"They removed ‚Äúadd lettuce as a bun‚Äù option, now with update they changed it to just ‚Äúlettuce‚Äù. Been using app for a long time to order lettuce wrap to replace bread bun, they removed that option and only let you add a slice of lettuce‚Ä¶ ummm I want the lettuce on both sides of the sandwich not just the bottom part. Who changed this and why? Even in the store now the employees look confused and don‚Äôt know how to put a piece of lettuce on both sides of the burger, now they only put a slice of lettuce on the bottom of the burger, what good is that? When you put the option to ‚ÄúADD lettuce as a bun‚Äù again then I will change my review and when you also train staff around the world how to add 2 pieces of lettuce again instead of one piece I‚Äôll give a better review, staff somehow forgot what add lettuce as a bun means, I guess we can blame the pandemic for making everybody forget simple easy things, it‚Äôs really rough out there guys!"
"With all the other fast food apps they have so many broken aspects. Not to name names, but others won‚Äôt let you add payment, won‚Äôt select a restaurant if you aren‚Äôt close enough, menu glitches, etc. Wendy‚Äôs has constructed a fully functional easy to use food app with great offers and reward systems. You can order food way ahead of time. If you don‚Äôt show up you get refunded on your digital account. I only use the app since I collect points every time and if you save long enough you can get top menu items. They give you a bunch of offers for free saving $10 in several trips. Really great. Had to say something nice about it."
"App looks nice and generally functions well. There is currently a bug I am experiencing where it does not show me what I have in my bag/cart, only the total. I recently tried to place an order and it only showed me my total, which was much higher than it should have been. I suspect this is because it had saved the previous order I had in progress, but I couldn't delete my previous items, again, because it didn't show me the items I had in my bag. Force closing and reopening the app did not fix it.

Additionally, it is not intuitive with regard to how to find customization options (e.g. no tomato on this burger), and customization isn't even available for drinks (e.g. no ice). There's also no notes section as a workaround.

For these reasons there is no reason for me to continue using the app."
"First, lets talk about the fact that every time you open the app, you are immediately stricken with a terms & policy agreement.  You cannot proceed further if you do not agree.  Never agree to something where you do not know the terms; that‚Äôs stupid.  Second, the app is slow and wastes time.  It‚Äôs dumbed down with an animation of a Frostee, that gets annoying after a while because he‚Äôll interfere with your order until you at least hit the close ‚ÄòX‚Äô button twice.  Finally, and this is probably my biggest gripe..the orders DO NOT even register half the time!  This can easily lead to a confrontation at the drive-thru window, where people are getting angry for no reason at all.  Utterly preposterous the way I‚Äôve seen some local Wendy chains being run.  Other places are worse however, but this is the real gimmick behind the reward system.  Gotta keep pushin‚Äô out the trash. Enjoy the ‚Äòfood‚Äô. ‚ò†Ô∏è"
"Took a few try‚Äôs to get the hang of it. For example if you want a Diet Coke you have to hit the coke freestyle button to find it, otherwise it just looks like you can only order lemonade. I had no idea what freestyle was-it‚Äôs a bunch more options!  Please add an option for ice preferences on drinks. I prefer no ice. Thanks!

One more issue-it took me quite a while to figure out how to use the rewards. I thought that just by adding the rewards I would get the item. Instead you must also add the item. I lost quite a few rewards this way because it deducted the reward even without adding the item. :(

Love that I can choose curbside! Even if you don‚Äôt order through the app you can open it when paying & have the barcode scanned for points."
Sometimes this works sometimes it doesn‚Äôt. It depends on the restaurant and the day. It‚Äôs ridiculously touchy as it used to work great with loading funds and letting me pre order now it stopped and it won‚Äôt let me use rewards even with over 900 points. The restaurants don‚Äôt have any ability to help and when you call app support they don‚Äôt know what to do either. They ask you your account info and reset it for you then say make sure you have the most up to date version. I do and I have deleted and reinstalled the app many times and logged out and logged back in and changed the credit card on file and even with plenty of money available it won‚Äôt let me use the card. The only thing the app is good for it seeing the menu before getting to the restaurant. Otherwise don‚Äôt waste the space on your phone.
"App is good but it would be better with apple pay or the ability to use credit cards in mobile pay.

I didnt have my credit card as I step out with my son to drop off some xmas gifts before the snowstorm. With COVID Walmart, grocery store, target, etc all turned to phone pay anyways.

I went by wendys order my food, offer and keychain frosty. Got to the window said I didnt have my card but was using mobile and ask if it would work. Lady wasnt sure. It took my offer coupon (great), my remaining gift card balance (great) but did not take the remaining balance from the card (bad). Had to drive out without the food while my son asked about his frosty. Now I just need to see if my money goes back to the gift card in the next 24 hrs along with my unused offer."
"I should‚Äôve clicked the ‚Äúno‚Äù button on the pop-up asking ‚Äúare you loving the app?‚Äù Yeah, no. It‚Äôs slow, and freezes up frequently during the course of trying to place an order. When it opens, it says hello with my name, but then it asked me to sign up for an account. Obviously, I already have one or it wouldn‚Äôt be calling me by my first name. Nevertheless, I tried to sign in, only to find my password didn‚Äôt work and I hadn‚Äôt saved it anywhere. So I clicked on forgot my password and waited basically an eternity for no email to show up and give me an option to change my password. Not loving the app so far. I‚Äôve wasted more time trying  place an order than it would‚Äôve taken to get in my car and drive down there, place the order, wait in line and pick it up."
If I could give this app no stars I would. This app is terrible. Not only does it flat out not work but no matter what I‚Äôve tried in order to get credit for my purchased doesn‚Äôt work either. Really disappointed because Wendy‚Äôs used to be my favorite but they need to update and figure out why their stores are going downhill. All of the Wendy's around me are full of slackers and people who don‚Äôt do a very good job at representing Wendy‚Äôs. Really stunned at the fact that the corporation is slacking and allowing their stores to become utter trash. Glad I have a Chick-fil-A in the area because I will no longer go to Wendy‚Äôs due to the poor service and no help whatsoever on the app by employees. I talked to the manager at the store today after many unlucky mobile order attempts and she had no idea. Really sad to say in the least. Hope change comes soon. Sad to have ruined my childhood favorite.
"I am a great customer of Wendy‚Äôs and they have permanently deleted me from the Wendy‚Äôs app.   I have contacted you everyday for over a week and was told a supervisor would contact me.   A new manager kept scanning my app.   I know I should have read the terms and conditions but as a training supervisor he should have known not to scan my app but once.  All I am asking is to reinstate my 2394 points and reactivated my account.   I eat at Wendy‚Äôs at least twice a day.   Please contact some of the managers at either Collinsville or the Ridgeway, Virginia Wendy‚Äôs.   They will all tell you we are one of there best customers.   So I‚Äôm hoping the next time I check my app that it is active.

Sincerely 
K. Tiller"
"So I was traveling and ordered through the app at one of their locations, but when I go inside the guy tells me that the order was ‚Äúweb failed‚Äù  and said he would not give me my food yet my card was charged for the food.  I had to pay again in the store because I had to get back on the road and he then tells me to call the app... so I call the number in the app only for them to tell me that the Wendy‚Äôs I just left will call me so I can get a refund, what???  When they do contact me days later, they can‚Äôt give me the refund to my card but can send me a check...

This app is useless and you risk the chance of not getting your food even if you are charged, only to have to go through the hassle of phone calls and checking mail, what a joke.  Instead of giving me my food and dealing with it themselves, he tells the customer to go through the hassle..."
"I downloaded this app for a free chicken sandwich, and in the end it wasn‚Äôt worth it. The  mobile app‚Äôs UI, while aesthetically pleasing, is slow and unresponsive. (On my iPhone11.) It was difficult getting the app to recognize an offer. When I went to submit the order, I got several different errors. I had to restart my order several times to get it through. (My card information was correct the whole time.) When I arrived at the restaurant, the staff told me half of the items I ordered were not available. It took a good while for us to substitute items, frustrating the person behind us. (We got yelled at.) Somehow, the new order was still messed up. We got different items than expected, and my sandwich was somehow watery. Even when I went to lodge a complaint, that page was glitchy, and there isn‚Äôt any indication that the message got sent."
"I went 2 the Wendy‚Äôs on Poplar n Farmington n as ALWAYS, I received great fast n efficient customer service. My food was fresh made 2 order as I requested u can believe tht it was hot w/all the condiments n the service u get @ the drive thru n this was my first time trying 2 use my Wendy‚Äôs app n I couldn‚Äôt get it 2 wrk so the young lady called 4 the Mgr w/o me asking n I really really appreciated tht n tht the Mgr gave me my Senior Discount so tht was just a great experience so Thts why I‚Äôve NEVER had a problem @ this restaurant. üíØ= A++ SERVICE n I will continue 2 go 2 this location even though I‚Äôm closer 2 the one Thts in Cordova. Keep up the Excellent Job n very clean location outside whn u drive up.‚ùóÔ∏èüòé"
"Trigger warning - this review will be upsetting to anyone who likes getting what they pay for and doesn‚Äôt think they should have to spend hours of their life to get a refund when a company screws up. 

My experience illuminates a bunch of reasons not to use this app. I can only assume there are more. 

1. I ordered a pub burger but the store couldn‚Äôt make it. They charged me before the store told me they couldn‚Äôt make it. The store   could not reverse or refund the charge. 

2. There is no way in the app to dispute a charge or request a refund on a particular order. 

3. I called the number from the app and was on hold for over an hour and a half before I was finally told I would get a refund in 7-10 days.  

4. I had not gotten the refund 14 days later so I tried the online feedback/complaint form. Two more weeks later and I have never received acknowledgement of that, much less a refund, much less an apology. 

Look, mistakes happen. That‚Äôs why companies have and need legit customer service. I hate that this experience has turned me into a complainer over 8 bucks, but what is with this garbage customer service?  How much does this business model benefit from people getting annoyed and just letting them keep their money?"
"Absolutely enjoy the ease of ordering and having it ready when I arrive. Common sense in an uncommon time. The staff at the north Wendy‚Äôs in Bismarck ND have been absolutely kind and cheerful every time I go. Thank you for the kind hearted employees working hard to help make fast food still an option. In a time where graduate isn‚Äôt easy to come by, I definitely appreciate the employees at that location!! During this time Wendy‚Äôs employees deserve a thank you too Most people take it for granted. The staff deserves extra pay for sticking with it during the risk. I wish there was an option to tip on the app.  Keep up the great work! 

Thank you, 

Christina L. Harmon"
Ordered through the App today. They had us pull forward. You would think they might notice us waiting. And waiting. And waiting. I finally went inside and absolutely could not get one person to acknowledge me. The second time I asked to speak to the manager he appeared. He said they ‚Äúlost‚Äù our order. I was rightfully not happy at this point. After almost an hour the manager Kevin told us they were kind of busy today. I told him to give me my money back. He gave it to someone else to give to me. Not one kind word was spoken to me. Not one word of apology. The manager was trained poorly and the young lady working the front cash register was fairly new and needed assistance several times. I cannot recommend the Wendys on Broadway Extension in Edmond Oklahoma.
"twas 6:00PM, it was dark, cold, and i was miserable. I sat on a bench with my skateboard, wanting something to eat more then anything, i check my bank account, it says ‚ÄúCurrent balance: $3.25‚Äù I then go on the gram and see that Wendy‚Äôs is giving out free frostys with their medium fry orders. So i reluctantly order medium fries and start skateboarding to Wendy‚Äôs, so excited to have some fries and a Frosty. It was now 6:30PM. I arrive and the doors are locked, theirs employees but none of them seem to notice my short figure through the window. The drive through is packed. So i stand on the mobile order area for 25 min. I begin to feel my body numb from the cold so i give up and have my walk of shame up to Chick-Fil-A. I sit there defeated and tell my self, Never‚Ä¶‚Ä¶never again will i enjoy the beauty that was Wendy‚Äôs after this incident. I rest my case"
"I haven‚Äôt updated it yet and probably will not for a while after reading other reviewers. I love using this app especially since my kids prefer Wendy‚Äôs over other fast food burgers near us. I have had problems with my mobile order not showing up as paid when picking up at a particular location but I still like using the app.

Update:
I had to update as I could not go  any further without it. So now all the offers are for mobile orders only. McDonalds did this and I stopped using them. However, McD has since changed this. I prefer to place my order through the pick up window since it‚Äôs easier to customize my order. I will have to stop using Wendy‚Äôs until this is changed."
"This is not a review of the app‚Äôs function as I find that most features are actually very good. Reward system is great, and I have no complaints about that. The app itself however is very broken. It constantly crashes and every time I want to open it, I have to delete it and reinstall it just for it to open on my iPhone 12. Not sure if it‚Äôs an optimization problem or what, but it‚Äôs super inconvenient. The payment system for mobile orders is also broken. Submitting a payment usually results in an error and I‚Äôll have to back out, re-enter what card I‚Äôm using and how much driver tip and cvv, and then it might error out again after that. Best to just use the scan at restaurant feature for the best results. Needs some bugs worked out to be perfect."
"This was easily my worst experience with a delivery app in my life. While placing the order I kept getting errors but there was no explanation about what the errors were. I finally was able to place the order after three tries. 

Nearly an hour later and 25 minutes after my order was scheduled to arrive, I received a text that my order was cancelled. No attempt to contact me to change whatever issue there was. So I went into the app to reorder but the reward points and offer I used were still redeemed from my previous order. I went to the contact section to write a complaint and when I pressed submit, nothing happened. I hit submit again, nothing. No error message, just a page that sat there. So not only can I not order food on the app but I also can‚Äôt inquire about why I can‚Äôt order food on the app."
"For the second time I‚Äôve tried to order on the Wendy‚Äôs app. Everything goes thru and my card shows a pending payment. When I get to the drive-thru and wait the 30 mins, due to long lines, it takes to get to the speaker I‚Äôm told by the cashier that my order is not showing in their system but there‚Äôs a charge to my card. I‚Äôm not able to cancel it due to an error until I HAVE TO order without using any of my coupons or the deals on the app. Both times the cashier has been rude and snippy over it like it‚Äôs my fault the order isn‚Äôt showing up. I‚Äôve worked in ff so I know how busy places get but if I‚Äôm to use an app that doesn‚Äôt connect my order but will still try to charge me should I be the angry one and not the employees? Deleted the app after the repeat performance. I‚Äôd give a 0 if I could."
The pretzel buns are nasty! Please please please bring back the BBQ Cheeseburger! It‚Äôs the only burger that I never had to special order to be able to eat from Wendy‚Äôs! Always been a fan but not now that you‚Äôve taken the best burger you ever made! BBQ Cheeseburger!!!!!!!!! Don‚Äôt care for any of your salads but I order the one that‚Äôs easiest to take off all the nasty fruit that you think needs to be on a salad! I order salads now because they will take things off burgers but won‚Äôt serve me a cheeseburger w/just BBQ sauce & pickles! The onion strings were excellent addition to the BBQ cheeseburger. I can‚Äôt get them anymore either! Your salads aren‚Äôt that great either.
"The app was at first convenient and easy to use. However I do not understand why there is a cancel order button if they will not reverse the charge of an order not picked up. I went to a Wendy‚Äôs restaurant to pick up my mobile order through drive thru. They proceeded to tell me that they were out of fries. I did not want the alternatives offered and asked if they could remove it. I was informed that they had no control over the mobile order! So I saw the cancel option and decided to cancel the order all together. To this day, almost 30 days ago. I have not received a refund from my cancelled order that I did not pick up. As well as I‚Äôve tried to contact support from this app multiple times and no one bothers to respond or anything! The chat doesn‚Äôt even queue you to a rep.  So I will NOT use this Wendy‚Äôs app anymore."
What can you say.  Love how user friendly the app is. You can easily order how and what you want quickly. You can pick it up inside or around the pick up window.  You can scan the app from the window during pick up to accrue points from purchases you mak. Doesn‚Äôt take a long time to get a ‚Äútreat‚Äù from Wendy‚Äôs. Loveto get the surprise texts that offer discounts or little treats. You get offers from Wendy‚Äôs with this app that you will not get if you don‚Äôt have it. Who doesn‚Äôt want a treat especially when it could be a free one? So; what are you waiting for?
"The app is good but Wendy‚Äôs has not adequately trained their staff. I ordered and paid through the app but when I picked up my food the asked for payment again.
I explained I had paid through the app and they did not understand‚ÄîI was told the app didn‚Äôt actually charge for orders and you still had to pay.
So today I‚Äôm disputing the expected double charge on my credit card.
Wendy‚Äôs also doesn‚Äôt have a mobile order parking spot option so you end up having to get in the same long lines to either go through the drive through or coming inside anyway; kind of defeats the purpose of mobile ordering. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
"Where are the ‚Äòoffers‚Äô in the new update? Did you guys remove coupons from the updated app?? I can‚Äôt find them. 

I like the Wendy‚Äôs app, but some basic improvements could make it even better. 

One, let people save more than one credit card in their payments without making them type the whole number out, to streamline the mobile ordering process. Currently, you‚Äôre only able to save one card. 

Second, let there be a way to distinguish between personal and door dash orders. The way it is now, every mobile order that comes through on the app looks like a door dash order to staff, and stickers are placed on bags and drinks to deter tampering. Super annoying if it‚Äôs your own food on a personal order. 

And third, I think just a little place at the bottom of the order for ‚Äònotes‚Äô I think would be very helpful. Here customers could make requests for things that aren‚Äôt a menu item on the app, like extra napkins or light ice in their drinks. 

Just a couple suggestions :D"
"Don‚Äôt bother. There is probably a McDonalds
‚ÄòS nearby.  Their app works fine.  

App won‚Äôt accept my password. Tried to recover a few times over a weeks time, but never got the e-mail to reset.  Tried calling a few times but gave up after long holds.  Tried the text route to reset.  Two days later got a return text saying previous text is now closed.  No explanation or follow up.  I have more time to stay on hold today.  Been waiting 27 minutes now.  They just told me 9 people are ahead of me. Not looking too promising.  If I can‚Äôt preorder & pay for  fast food using an app, I skip that restaurant.  So that means I eat at McDonald's, Burger King, Sonic, Taco Bell, White Castle, and Chik-Fil-A instead of Wendy‚Äôs when the fast food urge strikes.  Dave Thomas must be rolling over in his grave."
"Downloaded the update and now the app is completely broken when it comes to checking out.

My experience- Live chat wasn‚Äôt working so this problem was never solved. The new app update will not let me check out. It says ‚Äúyour order is already being processed‚Äù. Additionally, the total like was $15 off (not that I could complete my order). So instead of being able to use my offers and rewards points we needed up having to pay full price and have an absolutely miserable experience with the app. This has NOTHING to do with the location (they are great!) and everything to do with this misleading and broken app.

Also the feedback option on this app doesn‚Äôt work either! Recommend avoiding this app until they fix it."
"I put in a breakfast order this morning. The app said ‚Äúplace order before 10:22 for breakfast items‚Äù so I think to myself ‚Äòok, I‚Äôll place it and head over!‚Äô I end up placing the order at 10:19 and after placing it, only then does it say ‚Äúpick up your order by 10:22‚Äù. First of all, why 10:22? When I look it up it says 10:30 is when breakfast ends...So I rush up to Wendy‚Äôs (I live about 5min away) drive up to the speaker and say I‚Äôm picking up my mobile order but apparently the app auto cancels it after 10:22 even though it said I paid and wouldn‚Äôt let me manually cancel before leaving the house...Needless to say I‚Äôve given up on Wendy‚Äôs breakfast. As we normally only do something like this on our days off and sleep a little later than normal.."
"App wouldn‚Äôt allow special offer. Had to delete it after trying twice. Third try paying for the sandwich (instead of getting it free), Visa declines with a fraud alert. Got that squared away and finally paid. By this time we were in the store. Order isn‚Äôt showing up. After awhile I asked, ‚ÄúWhat if it never shows up? I‚Äôve got my receipt here, we paid, I assume you‚Äôll give me our food?‚Äù The answer shocked me: ‚ÄúNope. There‚Äôs nothing we can do if it doesn‚Äôt show up.‚Äù It went back and forth with some claim how being in the store when you click pay is a problem; But I have seven kids here hungry and I paid; But that‚Äôs the app‚Äîit‚Äôs outsourced, nothing Wendy‚Äôs can do; But I‚Äôm a customer (who paid), and they‚Äôre all Wendy‚Äôs to me...
They stuck to their guns. And lost a customer for the future as often as I can help it."
"Update needed for mobile orders! ASAP! I went to go pick up my order and the app says all we need is you at the drive thru! When I get there, I was told I was to come inside because all mobile orders have to be picked up inside. Those workers are confused! I personally ordered thru the app & I do NOT work for any delivery companies. My order was even sealed with the delivery stickers. Well that‚Äôs not the problem, the problem is they insisted I come into the store to get my mobile order while all the cars that went straight to order from the drive-thru, well... was able to pick up at the drive-thru window. Does that even make any sense? Can you please have something that distinguish a personal mobile order from Uber, DoorDash, etc."
"For the most part, the app works great, but I‚Äôve found one area that always doesn‚Äôt. If I change the default salad dressing for any salad, the cart will show that I selected ‚Äúno‚Äù for the default, then it shows that I added a different one‚Ä¶.until it finishes updating the pickup method and payment option. Then, for some reason, it removes the ‚Äúno‚Äù from the default dressing. Therefore, the location always thinks I want two different types of dressing - the default that I can‚Äôt get rid of and the one I actually want. Fix this and I‚Äôd call it a 5-star app. Thanks!"
"For the second time this year I gave this app another chance. Again, I lost 30 minutes of my life!

Buttons like ‚ÄúProceed with order‚Äù become unresponsive for no reason. Then the whole app crashes and/or your selected items disappear. All without explanation. And phone support is only open until 8 pm EST. I live in Hawaii, so that means that if I go for dinner after 2 pm, nobody will answer. 

So I go directly to the store and let the cashier know I‚Äôm having trouble with the app. Of course, she can‚Äôt fix it, and it seems as if she‚Äôs heard those complaints before. So I order directly at the counter. It‚Äôs irritating that I can‚Äôt get the lovely ‚ÄúREWARDS‚Äù offered on the app. But more irritating that I lost 30 minutes of my life‚Äîfor the second time this year."
"Couldn‚Äôt even get through the registration process without receiving multiple error messages. First a message repeatedly saying e-mail address/password were having a problem, even though they appeared to go through the first time. Then, after hitting Forgot My Password ‚Äì nothing happened. No follow-up. To add insult to injury, upon trying to enter my birthday, it repeatedly said ‚Äúplease enter a valid response‚Äù yet even though I had to put in a date as normal. This prevented with the registration process from completing. Worst, when it directed me to a customer service phone number to call, I did so ‚Äì only to have a recorded message say ‚Äúwe‚Äôre sorry but we‚Äôre closed‚Äù despite being within the normal calling hours. NOT a good sign, all around! I promptly deleted the app."
"I downloaded this app yesterday and I thought it was really cool. There were a ton of coupons to use and all of the current offers were listed out. It is a very helpful app. Well after I used it I got rid of it so I could download another app faster. This morning I thought about getting Wendy‚Äôs again and decided to download the app again. Well now every time I try to sign in so I can look at the deals, the app crashes. I have space on my phone. The only reason I got rid of it before was to make another app download faster but I have space on my phone. That being said, I don‚Äôt think my phone was the problem. The app just crashes."
"Why are you sending me notifications about the app being out of date when I am fully up to date and tapping the notification just dumps me in the Wendy‚Äôs app with nothing related to the notification? ‚Ä¶nothing about the update, nothing about the current version being out of date‚Ä¶ nothing. It‚Äôs like you just wanted to disrupt your user base to inflate your daily active user count. Not cool.

Like most people I have automatic updates turned on but even if I didn‚Äôt then it‚Äôs because I wanted to manage that myself (usually to see the change log with each new version). The only appropriate way to notify me is when I launch the no-longer-supported version of the app or just let me check for App Store updates when I feel like it."
"Your UX team did a fantastic job with designing the experience. Your development team did an absolutely awful job implementing that experience. I suspect that Wendy‚Äôs didn‚Äôt offer enough $$$ in the contract to the programmers because it‚Äôs difficult to find a feature that actually works in this app. Payment never works, editing items never works (pickles show up as the bun, remove it in this glitched state and you get crash or unexpected behavior), mobile orders sometimes take 20+ minutes to place due to not functioning correctly. Your executives should download the app and give it a try themselves. Then you should hire me because I could write this app from scratch, multi platform,  using Ruby or Rust or something. Better be ready to pay me though because I‚Äôm not cheap"
"You can save a lot of money with this app, there are even days and you can get free stuff from it. But unfortunately when you use the app it‚Äôs super glitchy, the coupons don‚Äôt get applied, the coupons have to be applied in the right order, and then when you finally are ready to order you can‚Äôt submit your order because it has a glitch. If it worked every day it would be one of the best apps in the App Store but since it only works one in every four times that you try to use it, it‚Äôs a complete waste of time. Every morning when you want to use it and you think you‚Äôre going to get some bomb food at a bomb price, you you end up getting frustrated and paying full price and wasting your time."
"I downloaded it and had the app for a while, and was able to make a few fine orders through the app but then suddenly ever since September whenever I‚Äôd do an online order to try an use a coupon that‚Äôs only for mobile purchases, the order would keep saying there was an error and again when I‚Äôd try it, an error. My WiFi was fine, my service was fine, my phone was fine, my information for my card payment was fine and checked multiple times but the app would say error BUT STILL CHARGE MY BANK ACCOUNT then the people in the drive thru or inside at the register, would say they don‚Äôt see my order and wouldn‚Äôt give me my food. I deleted the app, and had to go through a bank dispute for my money that they took out multiple times but would keep saying ‚Äúerror.‚Äù The app is dysfunctional."
"In addition to the privacy concerns discussed elsewhere, a major limitation of this app is that you can‚Äôt get refunded for items they can‚Äôt fill. Their soda machine was down, and we had to go through the app itself afterwards to get ‚Äúrefunded.‚Äù Scare quotes because they add a coupon to our account for $3 that didn‚Äôt refund the whole amount of 2 large drinks and doesn‚Äôt stack with other (better) coupons that are freely available. We could go through a second time to ONLY get sodas and essentially pay $1.50 for sodas that we‚Äôd paid for weeks ago, but that‚Äôs a whole lot of waiting for something that should have been made right immediately with a the very least a full refund to our credit card."
"App is a bit clunky for ordering but usable. Real issue is if you have to cancel your order, or the location is out of what you order, you have no option to cancel or refund. And it can take WEEKS trying to get a response while they keep your money, and then however long the actual refund takes. Location can‚Äôt refund due to using the app, app has no option, and customer service is lackluster not answering emails/texts/phones. Have to be loud on Twitter to even get a nominal review of the situation. 

Terrible, terrible, design to not have refund or cancel option. Don‚Äôt spent anymore through the app than you are willing to completely lose for an indiscriminate amount of time."
I‚Äôve been using this app for a few months now. I have really enjoyed the convenience. I can go through the entire menu and not be concerned about holding up the line in drive-thru or at the register. I don‚Äôt have to store a credit card which allows me to make a purchase with whichever card I want to use. And I get offers every day. It‚Äôs so easy. And I can choose whether I want to pick up my order or have it delivered. No worries over the accuracy of my order. It‚Äôs right there for the store to see and fulfill.
"App worked okay for a long time (‚Äúokay‚Äù = sometimes it wouldn‚Äôt let me get to the order screen, but I found a way around it by clicking and holding on the app icon and selecting ‚ÄúOrder‚Äù). However, when I tried to use it on February 23, 2022 it had logged me out and would not let me log in again. Error message is ‚ÄúError: An account could not be created. Please contact Customer Care. Contact information can be found on our website or in the Help & Feedback section of our app.‚Äù This is when I‚Äôm trying to *log in*, not create a new account. I tried again today (March 7) and I‚Äôm still getting the same error. I‚Äôve tried

- Creating a new account. Got the error ‚Äú‚Äòlogin‚Äô is not formatted correctly.‚Äù
- Uninstalling and reinstalling the app (didn‚Äôt fix it).
- Tried creating an account again, but same error.
- Tried using the ‚ÄúLive Chat‚Äù feature in the app. It said I was #1 and an agent would be with me shortly, but after 5 minutes no agent joined.

If Wendy‚Äôs reads reviews, do you have any idea how to fix this?"
"This app is good enough - it does the job... descriptions are not the best (for example what comes in a ‚Äúbiggy bag‚Äù - one has to go ask google cuz the app doesn‚Äôt tell you)... 

Biggest problem is with the drink selections - my store has mellow yellow and does not offer orange soda. The app offers an orange soda option but does not display the mellow yellow option - so to get what we want we order the drink that doesn‚Äôt exist so they can‚Äôt pre-make it... and have to ask for what we want outside of the app. 

The first try I wanted orange soda and they gave a mix of mellow yellow and fruit punch - to match colorü§£üòÇü§£creative but not what was allowed to be ordered in the app! üòÇ"
"I think that Wendy‚Äôs has a wonderful selection of food. The quality is unlike any other fast food place I have eaten at. The only problem I have with Wendy‚Äôs is the expense. The cost is a little much, but I do enjoy the food very much. Edit: After consulting with a few friends, we have come to the conclusion that Wendy‚Äôs is very well priced. Thank you so much Wendy‚Äôs. Your food is delicious and fills me with contentment. I wanted to make this as a joke, but I really can‚Äôt clown on Wendy‚Äôs. I hope everyone has a great experience at Wendy‚Äôs as well. Have a good day."
"So, Wendys is a GREAT fast food place. My favorite even. But I can‚Äôt drive yet so I have to have my parents take me. And my mom is vegetarian and my dad doesn‚Äôt like Wendys. But if there were vegetarian options like a veggie burger or veggie nuggets or something, I would come here more. And maybe like a small salad with your food or you can buy just a medium salad. Then we could come there more because my mom and dad would be happy with the food choices. I am not complaining, but that is my suggestion."
"I gave this app a star a while ago. I was scrolling for choices before I decide on which.  I am impressed to see the calorie and prices adjusted as I customize the burger.  A major improvement here.  So I gave this a three star.   Before I give it an additional star, I will check to see how easy and intuitive the reward part of the app.  Lastly the digital Frosty key chain was so disappointed.  I should have bought for physical key chain so I can get Frosty and one of the deal offer.  I cant do that with digital version.  If they improve the reward program and fixed digital key chain, I would give this app a 5 stars."
"I think mobile ordering is a neat idea, and usually facilitates a smooth fast food experience. But this just isn‚Äôt working. At about 10 am, I placed an order on the app for breakfast. The app told me to ‚Äúget here soon‚Äù as they wouldn‚Äôt start my food until I got there and checked in, so I might miss breakfast. I guess it makes sense so as to not waste food, but what‚Äôs the point of starting my food after I‚Äôve checked in AT Wendy‚Äôs? The reason for mobile ordering is to expedite things.
So then we get to Wendy‚Äôs and the app tells us to pull up to the drive thru, and that‚Äôs a whole dumb experience of it‚Äôs own."
"Many technical difficulties when trying to PAY for my order.
Placed my card info then hit submit. It then asked for a cvc so I input that as well. It says error. I try to resubmit, error because I already placed this order. Start over,
Submit. Won‚Äôt work. Error.
I am then unsure if I even placed my order at all, if my card went through ever, or if it charged 3 times since I tried to resubmit several times.
Then it came to the actual food... 
SO, I ordered a spicy chicken sandwich and used the app to take off the mayo and tomato.
It SHOULD have just chicken and lettuce at this point on it.
Then it said ‚Äòsauces‚Äô. I figured since I took the mayo off, I could dip it in honey mustard or ranch.
WELL. It came as a bun, chicken, and both sauces... smothered on top of it.
I Don‚Äôt know if it was just less than logical people running running the prep thinking that would be a great idea or if the app is so misconstrued that I actually asked for that compared to sauce packets...
Really kinda ruined my experience for wendys.
Not even to mention how impersonal it is when using the app so the only time someone greets you is to hand you the bag.
Gotta stick with my chickfila üôÉ"
"I‚Äôve used this app in particular for months. Every now and then it‚Äôll get a bug and crash if I do a certain action, or it‚Äôll be unable to use the same card, but this time, the issue was with a coupon.

I‚Äôm led to believe this is purposeful and is just a transparent coupon that cannot be used. Let me explain; The issue this time was that I could not press the blue order button, I used a coupon and I‚Äôd thought perhaps the app needs to be refreshed.

Still didn‚Äôt work. So my second plan was to spend extra by not using the coupon. I ordered a random item on the menu and soon after pressed the order button. It Worked like a charm. I‚Äôm not sure who is behind the deals but whatever middle ground they reached with the team who is responsible for the app should be revised."
"Consistently have errors at checkout stating there may be a problem with the accepting digital orders at the restaurant. More information needs to be provided. Many times the error is simply a product not available, and if that item is removed the order will go thru. This type of information needs to be provided so the order can be edited. Also, there is no way to provide feedback within the app, except about a restaurant visit. There needs to be a portal to provide this type of feedback directly, it is an app problem, so we should be able to provide feedback in the app."
"I‚Äôve had issues with two separate Wendy‚Äôs restaurants receiving my order twice in a row now. My card was still charged in both cases. For the first time, I waited while on hold with Wendy‚Äôs customer service folk for about half an hour, and then the order finally went through. This time I decided to not spend a half hour or longer waiting. Please make these systems fully functional!

Edit: I was able to get a refund by calling customer service (I sent requests through the app and via email a good day before calling too). The wait was over half an hour, though! Still, my main pain point is the app‚Äôs messed up ordering functionality. Fix that and I wouldn‚Äôt need to call in the first place!"
"I know I‚Äôm not the only person to complain about it since I have read other reviews online. Every time I go to use the offers, I always get an error message. It‚Äôs always something that has to do with a free item you get with a purchase.  I placed the purchased item in the basket, followed by the free item; error.  I try again this time by placing the free item in the basket, then the item that I need to purchase. Of course I get another error. What‚Äôs the deal? You talk to the people in the Wendy‚Äôs restaurants and of course they all say the same thing; we have nothing to do with the app. Is there nothing that anybody can do to fix these issues? I have this problem literally all the time. I never get to enjoy the offers!"
"Worthless app, expect to get money stolen if you try to order with it. I went to Wendy‚Äôs back in November 2020 and the app effectively stole my money when it took my order, then the store refused to give me my order because they didn‚Äôt know how to process the order and accused me of not paying. After six months of trying to get a refund from ‚Äúsupport‚Äù (they constantly ignored me), they gave me an $8 credit. When I tried to use that (at another location), they once again accused me of not paying because they didn‚Äôt know how to process the order and again I did not receive my food, but money was taken from me. Now I‚Äôm waiting for support to refund THAT order (it‚Äôs already been two weeks and nothing so far)."
"This has to do with the Wendy‚Äôs app transition to delivery 3rd party app. The ad is sent as a notification to the user of an offer by the Wendy‚Äôs app. When someone decides to act on the offer and starts the order and chooses to deliver it, Wendy‚Äôs app obviously prompts the 3rd party app where the offer is completely lost. Wendy‚Äôs does little or nothing to avoid this bug and to honor the offer click. The 3rd party app is obviously  not going to take responsibility for that hand off. This is very frustrating and misleading on the part of the Wendy‚Äôs advertising practices and ordering model. Other than this, the app is fairly ok. I find that Wendy‚Äôs- Postmates transition works best for ordering."
This app uses more battery through background activity and location services than any other app I‚Äôve ever used. Turn those off ASAP. I installed the app on a new phone had never even opened it and it was 25% of my battery usage for the day. I disabled background refresh and it chilled out. But I used it for the first time since I got the new phone today and it weaseled it‚Äôs way into all the time location services. The phone actually popped up a warning that it had accessed my location a ridiculous amount of times today. I checked my battery page and it said it had used 17% of my battery and been running location services in the background for an hour 51 minutes when there was 10 minutes between me ordering and picking up food.
The app itself is great you order before hand is very convenient. The only things that need to improve is making 2 lines one for app and another for those who want to order at the speaker. I‚Äôve had to wait in line 25 minutes it‚Äôs bananas and when I got to the speaker after waiting for people ordering I just tell them my name and the tell e to pull up so as you see it made my order fast by the experience not so much but I‚Äôm sure they are already thinly of this and ways to improve
"I used to use this app when getting food from Wendy‚Äôs but now I just ever get that an error has occurred. I have 5 kids and going through the drive thru to do an order is annoying. I liked using the app but for whatever reason they decided to make it to where it no longer works. I have completely closed the app and opened it again, I have emptied the cart and started over, I have deleted the app and re downloaded and just keeps saying an error has occurred. This has been going on for at least a month maybe longer. I know I go there a lot less because of it and I am sure other people do too. They should remove the app from the App Store if they no longer want people to use it"
"After the recent update, I cant use the app unless I go under terms and conditions and re-route to the menu. I use custom DNS and I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs the reason for app not to function properly. Secondly, once you place the order and order hasn‚Äôt been picked up and you want to place the 2nd order, there is no way to do it since the system waits for 1st order to be picked up. That‚Äôs a sucky since I was trying to order more before I can pick up my order but there is no way to do it. I tried using web browser and it also directed me to All set! We have got your order. Next‚Ä¶"
"This app is completely useless. Requires an update every time I use it and then won‚Äôt show your rewards points, or has them as zero when you have well over 400.
Today I logged out to to see if logging back in would fix the issue, and I get errors when trying to log back in. Haven‚Äôt been able to log back in at all. 
Customer support on the app is a joke. No one ever answers the live chat, you will be 1st in line for 15-20 mins waiting for an agent who never answers.
Trying to email contact us will only allow you to make a complaint or inquiry against a particular store.
Useless! Will be patronizing Wendy‚Äôs much less frequently now, as the rewards and app offers were my primary reason."
"This app‚Äôs food and beverage menus work great except after adding any special offers to my order for drive-thru pick-up, I get error messages saying ‚Äúspecial offer cannot not be made on time with this.‚Äù I‚Äôm forced to remove it. Plus, special offers added on with order don‚Äôt show on restaurant worker‚Äôs receipt print outs either. That‚Äôs now, two free sandwiches Wendy‚Äôs owes me from Special Offers on this lousy app. And anytime I place an order on this app, next day they send me a remind notice to add a Special Offer to what I order. Plus, the app doesn‚Äôt save your e-receipt to show restaurant workers proof Special Offers added with your order(s)."
"Love your food Wendy‚Äôs!

But I noticed today that the option to order cheese sauce with my fries has disappeared. In the past I could pay extra and get a small cup of cheese sauce with fries. Today there‚Äôs no sign of it in the app, even though I can order it at the store. Please bring back the delicious cheese sauce!

Just one other feature would make my Wendy‚Äôs life complete. Please add an option to get receipts for app orders emailed to me instead of printed. C‚Äômon, help save the environment by creating less paper waste. Love ya Wendy‚Äôs!"
"This app has a lot of potential to be great, but it‚Äôs the lack of basic functionality that makes it very frustrating for the end user. Some examples: utilizing coupons/reward codes is a nightmare. You add the coupon and sometimes it doesn‚Äôt ‚Äústick‚Äù to the order and you have to go back to the rewards page to add it. When loading checkout screen, I waited 2mins, gave up, went to the previous screen and order didn‚Äôt persist, had to restart. Upcharges on sizes aren‚Äôt presented until checkout and it‚Äôs not itemized. Ice cannot be removed from drink (basic function cmon!) 

There is a pop up every time I open the app asking me if I want a walkthrough of how to use the rewards tab. 

Poor UX, needs dev work"
"I have been to Wendy‚Äôs before. Was very excited to try their new app. Had high expectations for it. Was hoping it would stand out ahead of their competitors. As a result it is set up for failure. Their deals of either free fries, $1 nuggets or other specialties with the app is false advertisement so don‚Äôt count on it, the app will not allow you to process. In terms of upgrading meals, the app kept freezing up. When you also go to pay on the app, expect the app to charge your bank or credit card twice without notice. So hopefully you have bank notifications to immediately catch it. As for pickup, only expect drive through, do not count on pickup inside at all. Your off better going inside to order food rather than using the app."
"Absolute garbage. My current problem is I‚Äôm trying to place a mobile order through the Phone app, and I can get everything I want in the cart but it will not show a total or subtotal. I also had to upload money to the Wendys digital card, and now I can‚Äôt place an order so not only am I  out 15 dollars on my debit card and can‚Äôt buy food. My problem with that is I cannot transfer the money back to my card.I also  ran into a problem previously maybe a couple months ago, where I was at lunch with coworkers and so happen to get my app scanned to collect all the points and the next day they were all gone. It‚Äôs disheartening you have to leave a star, even for such a poor app."
"I used this app ALLLLL the time! I saved rewards, saved points etc... it was awesome and I probably ate there 5x more often than ever before, and more than any other restaurant. I could just pre-order and pick up at window. Then the app got ‚Äúupdated‚Äù ..... and never worked again. I‚Äôll put stuff in my bag only to find that it has ‚Äúerrors‚Äù. I thought it was just my store until I tried to use it at a different location. Also, when I applied my reward it took the points.... even though I wasn‚Äôt actually able to place the order. I‚Äôve waited for the bug to be fixed, but it hasn‚Äôt. I think it may be time to just delete it."
"I ordered from my local Wendy‚Äôs WEEKS ago through the mobile site. I got an email confirming my order. When I got to the restaurant I was told there was no record of my order, and they couldn‚Äôt issue a refund since there was no record of the order. They told me I had to contact customer service. Fine. I then contacted Wendy‚Äôs customer service through text since I‚Äôd have a record of the conversation. 

I was told after several chats with multiple agents that someone from the restaurant would contact me to issue a refund. I waited a week. Crickets. Then went through the process again. It‚Äôs been over a month now. Garbage service and a garbage app. I won‚Äôt be supporting Wendy‚Äôs in the future."
"I like the app itself, but it‚Äôs disappointing that we can only use one reward at a time. At most other food places, like Chick-fil-A, Starbucks and even Cheddars and Old Chicago, you can save your points and then get almost an entire order at no cost‚Ä¶ I have 1400+ points but can only use one reward at a time so I use 450 for a sandwich and still pay $20+ dollars for breakfast w my kids. Meanwhile I still have close to 1000 points. Please let us use our points as many as we want in one order."
I love the Wendy‚Äôs app. I use to all the time because there‚Äôs one by my job and right down the street from my house. Once I ordered at around 9 p.m. and asked my cousin to pick it up from the location by my house. It wasn‚Äôt until about 10 when he called telling me they didn‚Äôt have my order so he just bought the food. I checked my app and realized I selected the wrong location. I changed it to the right location just like it says you can. When I checked it again it was after 11. Wendy‚Äôs closes at 11 so my order disappeared and my money was never refurbished to my card. I am very disappointed with Wendy‚Äôs.
"A few weeks ago I placed a delivery order through the app. When the food arrived (an hour later than estimated) the name on the receipt was correct, but nothing that I ordered was delivered. It seemed like my order got mixed up with someone else‚Äôs. It didn‚Äôt bother me that the order was wrong, I know stuff happens, mistakes happen. But when I tried to get in touch with customer service to get a refund or credit I couldn‚Äôt get in touch with anyone. I tried the chat feature, text, called and even left feedback on their website and still no answer after days of trying. Because of this experience I won‚Äôt be using the app anymore and probably will just not eat at Wendy‚Äôs anymore"
The app works well and seems user friendly. It is only going to succeed if there is a seamless integration with the way the stores are run. I placed my first app order for curbside pickup at my local Wendy‚Äôs. Clicked on ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here‚Äù when I arrived at the store. After 20 minutes or so I entered the store to inquire as to my order. The employee I spoke to walked over to the register and pulled out my order. I‚Äôm guessing she then put my order in back of all the drive through orders already in progress because I waited at least another 15 minutes for my order. No apology or explanation. Overall not a good first app experience right off the bat.
"Last night I ordered delivery that was supposed to be at my place in 22 - 23 minutes. The time kept extending longer and longer and eventually I called the number for the driver and he said his DoorDash app had crashed. I went to the restaurant to try and just pick it ok after over an hour of waiting and they had never even received the order. But here I am, still out the money AND the rewards points I used on the order. Now I am trying to get help on the support function of the app and it just sits and spins even though it says I am first in line. I guess you will be dealing with a chargeback from my bank now since you refuse to offer any support whatsoever."
"I love being able to order our food while my husband drives us to the drive-thru, and I love being able to use Apple Pay to pay for it. 

What I don‚Äôt like is that after we‚Äôve been and gone, the Wendy‚Äôs app still shows that the drive thru is waiting for us to come pick up our food. The food that we already picked up and ate.  It even suggests there‚Äôs time to change my order. Even though the order was placed yesterday, picked up and consumed.

It‚Äôs annoying that every time I launch the app, I have to struggle for 5 minutes to get last time‚Äôs order to go away so I can start placing this time‚Äôs order.  

Once the order is placed everything works like a charm, until I get ready on another day to place another order. Then I have to go thru the whole cancel and poke and guess process to get the new order started."
"The app is only good for placing an order on a good sunshiny day. Not literally, of course, but there‚Äôs only one use-case that it works for.

If you need to look up nutrition information for breakfast baconator, good luck. I‚Äôve given up trying. Did I check all the products, no. Maybe it works 90%, but if it doesn‚Äôt work for the one thing I need it for, then it works 0%.

The second thing that happened, out of three uses of the app, was that I placed an order, drove 7 minutes to the store to find it closed. Why would it even take the order? I should‚Äôve known there was a problem when it hung up on payment, but I thought it was just being slow. 

Given it worked one out of three times perhaps I should‚Äôve rated it a two instead of a one, but it deserves a one for being such a stupid design. Given it worked one out of three times perhaps I should‚Äôve rated it a two instead of a one, but it deserves a one for being so poorly designed.

My advice‚Ä¶ Stick to in person ordering, or go to McDonald‚Äôs."
"I love Wendy‚Äôs, the food and the prices. What I don‚Äôt love is this app. No option to use Google Pay or Apple Pay. Also, restaurants need to communicate better with this App. It seems like every time I place an order on this App, the employees look at me like I have 3 heads. Also, this is a major issue. When I place an order to be picked up in Drive-Thru, please don‚Äôt ask the Customer to come inside to receive their order. When they insist on that, I kindly tell them to cancel my App order and I will just order at the speaker. Come on Wendy‚Äôs. Get it together. If this doesn‚Äôt improve, I will just keep going to Chick-Fil-A. I‚Äôm so tired of rude employees at restaurants. This is in North Carolina."
"I had more than 800 rewards points a few weeks ago. Every time I open the app I have less points, now 613, even though the app says none are recently expired and the next expiration is in 9 months. I tried contacting Wendy‚Äôs support via live chat (on a Thursday afternoon) but closed it after being #1 on line for 20 minutes. I called the contact number (same day/time), but no agent picked up after 30 minutes. I tried using the contact form, but it is only for inquiries about a specific location‚Äôs service or food, not the rewards program. The app is half baked, they will steal your rewards points, and there is no way to contact Wendy‚Äôs to ask about it."
"The Wendy‚Äôs app stated the Wendy‚Äôs in my town was open til 10 pm. I ordered the meal, paid for it and drove over to pick it up. When I arrived the drive through had a hand made sign said closing at 8 pm. I drove around to the window and saw somebody inside. The lady opened the window and said they were currently closed. I said the app says 10 and I had paid for the meal. Before I could ask how to go about getting a refund on the order she yelled ‚ÄúDo you two want an application because we do not have enough help to stay open.‚Äù And slammed the window closed. I‚Äôm publicly apologizing if I sounded snarky in my comment about the app. But, I would be fired from my job immediately if I EVER spoke to a customer like that."
"Before an update a few months ago I had over 1500 points, login and password never changed but all my points disappeared after updating üò°. Also, tried to use an offer for mobile order only and wouldn‚Äôt accept my gift card, then tried to apply money from my debit card to my digital balance and it didn‚Äôt work. Errors with the payment options have been going on far too long, can y‚Äôall please address this? Trying to save a little money here and there and bugs in this app make it hard to want to continue coming here when other fast food apps have no issues."
"So just got the app, store I went to had no clue what I was talking about when I asked them to scan my account. Strike 1. I wait the up to 24 hours to see if my points show up- they don‚Äôt. Strike 2. I contact customer service about how to add missed scans. They give me a link to follow to give credit but it only works if it‚Äôs been within 24 hours of purchase. This link is not within the app but a separate one.  Beyond that they say they can do nothing. If I wait the 24 hours for points to show, I missed your window of credit. That seems pointless.  Please fix."
"When the app works, it's good. Not great, but good. There's usually problems with applying rewards and offers but it's usually not a big deal. Lately, however, something has changed where now it won't let me put in orders at all. I put everything in my cart, I have my address put in, I put in a debit or credit card that I know has plenty of money on it annnnnnnd nothing.

 ""We're sorry, a service error has occurred.""

Put in a new card, try to resubmit, same story. This has happened multiple times and for whatever reason the Wendy's app has just decided that it doesn't want my business anymore."
"I will sometimes have small hiccups with the app, but this recent change in privacy/ToC must have caused a massive error. I tried accepting the terms. Went to make a mobile order and there are no deals (I am in another state on vacation so maybe that is why??) it still had my last order in the bag (form like a week prior), took off the stuff from last time, said I was getting a discount of $5 still for some reason. Then said I owed $Zero, tried to fix TOS, payment, re-opening app, redownloading app. I can no longer log into the app, it keeps saying error, can‚Äôt reset password; just gives error."
"Great app when it works. But there are bugs constantly when I try to use it. It‚Äôll not pull up offers and sometimes be thinking and thinking and thinking and not let me finish my cart and buy my food on it. Fix the bugs and this becomes the best food app I‚Äôve ever used. No other fast food app comes close to the ease, frequent and recent order views, rewards, and offers if they work."
They need to update the app to not charge your card until you check in like McDonald‚Äôs because it‚Äôs been two weeks and I‚Äôm still waiting on them to refund my money from using the app and getting to the restaurant and them not having the items I ordered and they charged my card even after I cancelled the orders! This happened not just once but twice and again last night. Contacted them by leaving a message as well as chatting with a representative who claimed someone would call me but of course they never did. About to not only delete this app but also stop patronizing Wendy‚Äôs as a whole!
"Why make an app that gives deals exclusively to mobile orders, but encounters an error nearly every order attempt? I have tried several different credit cards, devices, restaurants, uninstalled and reinstalled the app several times, and dozens of different order permutations, only to receive error messages. At least tell my why there is an error! Wendy‚Äôs has been a bottom feeder of the fast food chicken industry for quite sometime now and the quality of the app reflects this. This is my first app review and I am only writing it because of how infuriating this app is. I want to give this app negative 5 stars. Absolute disgrace. Off to chick-fil-a and Popeyes not only because they are better, but BECAUSE I CAN ACTUALLY USE THEIR APP SUCCESSFULLY."
"The actual app is pretty good, but it‚Äôs frustratingly slow to order on. Maybe it‚Äôs pulling data from the network too frequently. For example, if I just want to change a drink from a small to a medium I end up waiting multiple seconds for the dialog to become responsive after display. Frustrating, especially when changing a few things. 

Also, a suggestion to allow choosing ‚Äúno ice‚Äù for drinks. I always have to request it at the window. Don‚Äôt want watery drinks by the time I get home."
"The app crashed on me. The menu is also visually confusing. Overall, not bad, and ordering was fairly easy once I familiarized myself with the layout and dealt with the app crashing.

I just placed my first delivery order. The ETA was only 19 minutes, which makes me skeptical. I‚Äôm cautiously optimistic, but expecting it to be late. 

I am happy that you offer Salads that are gluten free (at least the Southwest Avacado Chicken salad is). And I am grateful that your fries are gluten free. Please consider offering more gluten-free options, as it is very difficult for people with celiac disease to eat out."
"The app crashes constantly and with the latest update won‚Äôt allow you to find locations, do mobile ordering, or anything else. The only thing it says is error. 

It‚Äôs a sad disappointment of an app. I‚Äôve tried for a full year to ‚Äúlove‚Äù this app and get it to work. It‚Äôs worked a total of six, yes only 6 times out of 50+ attempts.  I deleted it twice in the past week and re-downloaded it trying to get it to work to no avail. 

It‚Äôs also unnecessarily complicated. It‚Äôs hard to get a deal loaded into the app for use. On top of that you can‚Äôt really navigate backwards to change an order when your child decides they want nuggets instead of a burger. The app doesn‚Äôt work well with in-store interfaces and can crash the restaurant‚Äôs computers. 

Please fix the glitches. Make it easier for newbies and those that use the app regularly.  Please install a back button so you can easily change an order when your kid changes their mind. Fix the location tab on all parts so mobile ordering works again."
"Typical wait for drive thru is 20 mins at our local Wendy‚Äôs since there‚Äôs no option for curbside pickup parking spots let alone in store (store is locked so you can‚Äôt even go in). There are usually 7-8 cars and only I window to order from.  I usually see at least 3-4 cars get frustrated and leave the line. You guys are losing customers and revenue!!!  McDonalds has this down pat with 2 drive thru lanes, 2-4 curbside spots and walk ins with masks. I had ample time to write this review while waiting in the drive thru line. Get your act together!"
"There are absolutely no features that allow you to contact support through the app, so when things go wrong (which they often have), there's no recourse. If your order is late or just doesn't get delivered at all (like mine just now), the best option you have is to look at the receipt. That's it. That's all you're able to do about it. Not contact the driver, or the restaurant, or even see where the driver is, let alone get a refund. 

Maybe you'll have better luck through the pickup feature, but delivery leaves much to be desired (like my food, which again I never got and have no idea where it ended up)."
"I downloaded this app and I really like it. It‚Äôs super convenient and you can pretty thoroughly customize your order. The only complaint I have thus far is there‚Äôs no option to put in your order and just pay cash when you get to the drive-thru. I‚Äôm still a little more old-school as far as money goes and prefer to use cash. So if there were a way I could still put in an order without it immediately charging a card of mine and pay cash at the restaurant, this app would be five stars for me."
"I really hoped to use the mobile app today, but there are still a couple of kinks in the ordering process. Why is there no sweet tea? The only option is unsweetened. A comment section might even remedy this, but there isn‚Äôt one. I think the app could also benefit from an arrival time specification, similar to the sonic app, so I could go ahead and order now for my food to be ready an hour from now. When these very small problems are worked out, I‚Äôm certain my kids and I will be using this app a lot, because we love some Wendy‚Äôs and eat take out a lot during the busy school week."
"I've used the app twice in one week. If the internet connection is slow it may not be able to process your order far enough to give you a confirmation or receipt. It will how ever have charged your account. They say it will fall off soon, but it'll be a week on Monday and it's still pending. I decided a second time to give the app a try, but it did the same thing today and I got the same response. The app needs to be debugged and the employees need training on its system for this to ever get off the ground. Otherwise, there will be a whole lot of unhappy customers wanting their money or food or both."
"I love that I can place an order, pay for it and just drive thru the pickup window and it‚Äôs ready. We use this app and order food at least once a week.  Love the way I can custom order my food to fit into my special diet and food preferences. I can also check the calories/carbs before I place the order and to tweak as needed.  We also take advantage of the specials and rewards points to save money. Best Fast Food App in our opinion üíï"
"So it‚Äôs my first time trying to use Wendy‚Äôs mobile order and probably the last time. For the kid‚Äôs meal I have fruit punch and small fries, and at the store the service people insisted I have milk and apple bites. I also chose drive through and they said I need to come in to the store, because the store system does not show it. The lady even said I should check my order to have them right and maybe my phone had some issues when I have my phone at hand showing what I ordered. Fine, blaming my phone... Why don‚Äôt you question your mobile app system that caused your system to show a different order from my phone? Anyways, one bad experience is enough. Bye."
"The only two reasons this is not a five star review is that I sometimes get an error when processing my credit card and have to put it in again and even though the app only recognizes one order, the Wendy‚Äôs location I have chosen sees two. It‚Äôs happened about 4 times over the past 3 months. The other is that I would like it if I could use my frosty tag in the app. I had bought one through the app and I can only use it at the store without the app."
"I love Wendy‚Äôs. But the experience I had this morning was insane. For starters it seemed like my order wouldn‚Äôt finalize on the app (also it wouldn‚Äôt register my gift card) so I pulled up to the speaker to ask if they got it/I had one, asked me the name and pull around. Basically totally ignored me, militantly tried to give me the wrong order insisting it was right. The staff wasn‚Äôt trying to solve the problem or even listen, just get rid of me. Finally I got it across to them that it wouldn‚Äôt let me check in (yes right address) so she told me I didn‚Äôt pay for the wrong food I was holding. So at that point I got tired of 6 people yelling at me and not listening, so I handed her all the food  and told her to never mind and left."
"The promotion was ‚ÄúGet 6 PC. Spicy Nuggets for free with any mobile order purchase. Just open or download our app, click ‚ÄòOffers‚Äô to redeem and add to your mobile order, then get your spicy on‚Äù. 
So I do just that. I download the app, make an account, click ‚ÄòOffers‚Äô, and the online coupon downloads. However I can not access my ‚Äúbag‚Äù (cart) that I just added the coupon to. Then I try ordering ANOTHER item than the FREE spicy nuggets. I am them allowed access to my ‚Äúbag‚Äù. I had to BUY something to get the FREE coupon. But wait, it gets better. Then, I prompted with a message that tells me the item, that the FREE coupon is NOT VALID with the item selection I have to PAY for! So now I can‚Äôt get my FREE spicy nuggets, or the item I HAVE TO PAY FOR!!!! Scam.."
"I received notice that I could get a free Breakfast Baconator with additional purchase. Unfortunately, I had to use the mobile order to get the offer. When I get to the drive through window, they claim the have no offer of the sandwich, that this is something that‚Äôs happened to other CUSTOMERS, and of course, that they won‚Äôt honor the offer or even give me a refund for the other item which I wouldn‚Äôt have ordered otherwise. The person at the drive through‚Äôs recommendation? I contact the app for a refund since the restaurant and app are completely separate things. The whole thing seems like a classic bait-and-switch and a game I don‚Äôt want to play"
"Just spent 15 minutes trying to place one simple order. First the app stuck in forever loading on the launch screen. Then it struggled mightily to just select my location. I selected a local Wendy‚Äôs, but it just froze in place and I had to redo it all over. The simplest function, taking my order, failed 4 times. Every time my bag would just end up being empty when looking to add additional orders. Then to top it all off, none of the offers actually work. Each time I try to apply it, it would also just reset the order with the coupon never showing up on the payment screen. Not worth the time or the frustration."
"I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever used this app without running into problems.

Whether it‚Äôs the abundant error codes that it throws in your face, to the constant deleting of your order before you can finalize your purchase, this app has made me rethink even going to a Wendys.

I recently got a gift card to Wendy‚Äôs and figured a chicken sandwich sounded good. I loaded the gift card onto my Wendy‚Äôs digital account and proceeded to try to complete a mobile order.

After searching their menu, the app crashed. 

Then on restart it wouldn‚Äôt show the ‚Äòadd to bag‚Äô option.

Then another restart, it shows the ‚Äòadd to bag‚Äô option, but when you get to checkout, it deletes your entire bag.

Finally, I restart the app a 3rd time and it proceeds to count all my previous orders at the top right, but it won‚Äôt let me check out and spews error codes at me saying it can‚Äôt view my order.

If you told me I could get 3 family meals for $1, but I had to order it on this app, I would refuse that offer every single time."
"If a fast food place like Wendy‚Äôs wants to keep ALL of its customers, then they should have a basic app for those of us with older phones!
The app stopped working on my phone, so I will no longer buy anything from Wendy‚Äôs.
Either keep an older version of your app for those that don‚Äôt upgrade to the best phones out there, or allow ordering on your website with my account and my rewards and any deals that are listed on the app.
I doubt if these suggestions will happen, because the upper management isn‚Äôt smart enough to realize that they are alienating many of their customers, and losing them because of this issue.
BOYCOTT WENDY‚ÄôS!!!"
"I appreciate the Wendys app, very intuitive and quick. It‚Äôs legit. BUT for areas that have the multi flavor Coke machines, it would be beneficial to have flavoring additives as options for your drink. As well as light or no ice. Or a place to write in before submitting an order ‚ÄúLight ice‚Äù or ‚ÄúNo ice‚Äù. Small things, but important to some. Overall, great app with ‚ÄúOffers‚Äù section that can save some bucks (I‚Äôm sure while promoting purchasing overall). You did good Wendy‚Äôs...you did good."
"Hello. Let me start off by saying, I apologize for throwing away my receipt. I ordered a jr. bacon cheeseburger and a small diet coke at apprx 3 pm on Sunday, 3/21.

Before today, I have been generally disappointed with the service at this location, however today was a breath of fresh air. I did not get the young lady‚Äôs name but she was professional, efficient, pleasant and engaging!  Kudos Wendy‚Äôs for hire her, and please recognize her for changing my experience at this location."
The concept of the app is great and I like being able to have all of the coupons just a click away and get free items for spending money on things I‚Äôm going to buy anyway. However if the app doesn‚Äôt stop crashing then trying to utilize its features becomes a moot point. Luckily I have a screen shot of my rewards QR to scan but it‚Äôs very cumbersome to have rewards or coupons that can not be used because the app will crash and get rid of the offers. Please fix this soon.
I‚Äôve been using this app for almost 2 years and I‚Äôve use it 98% of the time I get food. But now all of a sudden I can‚Äôt log back into my account after I was booted out and keep receiving an error message. I can‚Äôt even create a new account because that‚Äôs bugged as well. I can‚Äôt even order as guest because I have to be signed into an account. It was a great app while I got to use it but if nothing can be done about this glitch I don‚Äôt think I will be ordering as much Wendy‚Äôs as I used to if I have to verbally place an order.
"So far I‚Äôve really enjoyed the app, when it works. You can scan for points and I go here all the time so the points and offers save me a lot of money. BUT, the app works 50% of the time. There‚Äôs been times when I don‚Äôt have a lot of cash and so I try to use the offers, but they just don‚Äôt load. Once I tried to log out and log back in to fix it, but it just wouldn‚Äôt work. I couldn‚Äôt log back in.

I do recommend you should download it so Wendys can fix it more, but it‚Äôs still a work in progress."
"Honestly a bad app. My orders are constantly wrong, says error every time I order ( it‚Äôs not my service) and proceeds to place an order, charged me extra for stuff, I don‚Äôt even get the things I ordered and it‚Äôs always wrong. 

The worst thing is the actual location can‚Äôt do anything about the orders and can‚Äôt give refunds for the mistakes that occurred. I was told I would have to call and cancel it myself, but the offices are closed, so I was charged for food that I wasn‚Äôt given and the location does nothing to help. I recommend not using this app unless you want to be charged for things you didn‚Äôt order and can‚Äôt get refunded."
"My order error rate has dropped significantly since I started to use the app instead of ordering from the recently released felon you have taking your order at the counter.  On top of that, the wait is shortened by not having to repeat ‚Äúno pickles‚Äù 4 times.  On top of that I also don‚Äôt have to worry about my credit card being skimmed.  The app is the way to go, people."
"The Wendy‚Äôs app is pretty good: the daily deals are economically friendly. The only problem I ever had with the app was that when applying a daily deal you had to remember to choose the food item and then choose the deal. You couldn‚Äôt just use the deal, If you didn‚Äôt also order the item you couldn‚Äôt get it free. It was very confusing at first, but I eventually figured it out. It would have benefited me if that had been explained from the beginning."
"I love the app and always check it to see if there are any deals. However I WILL NEVER use mobile pay. You should offer more deals for both in restaurant and mobile pay. There have been multiple occasions I have seen a coupon, got excited, clicked on it, saw mobile pay, and decided not to go to Wendy‚Äôs. Especially with the amount of issues people have reported with mobile pay, why would I ever want to give this app that personal information. No thanks."
"I have tried the chatting window, to contact anyone about issues with the coupons not working, it shuts down with no response then I tried messaging someone finally at 1am I got a response that the text window was closed what a ridiculous waste of time ! Don‚Äôt download this app nothing works on it and no response from anyone either the creators or customer service"
"I don‚Äôt often leave reviews but this app really pushed me. I tried to log in to claim something from the T-Mobile give away. It asked for all my info to log in, done. No issue. I go to log in, it says cannot be completed and contact them. I try to message with someone - I‚Äôm #1 in line for 15 minutes, nothing. I tried to create another account, says I already created one. I tried calling using the # in the app, I hit 5 for app support. Doesn‚Äôt register. I hit 5 again and again, it hung up on me because apparently I‚Äôm not there. Y‚Äôall got enough snark on your Twitter - make your app work. This is way too much effort to get a free fries."
"I've been using this app for a week. My offers stopped being applied. Everytime I add an offer, the app is telling me something went wrong and I need to add more items to get the offer applied. I do add more and still no luck. Another thing is I can't even check out. The app tells me there is a processing error and recommends to check with my bank. I did check with the bank and I was told my card and account are all good and that I'd better talk to the vendor aka Wendy's. I texted Wendy's and they responded in a few days telling me that they don't know what's happening and they will investigate it. No answer since then."
Where is the I‚Äôm here button? Sometimes I place an order for breakfast and someone else will pick it up. It wants me to tap ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here‚Äù by 10:22 but there is no button saying that. I‚Äôve had them cancel half my order before because I wasn‚Äôt able to let them know I was there to pick up and as usual they were lined up around the building. It takes at least 30 minutes to get through our Wendy‚Äôs drive through most of the time.
This is the third time I have ordered through the app and it says they are open for mobile order pick up and I park outside the restaurant which has a drive-through line all the way around the building and the inside part of the restaurant is locked. I have even tried to call the location to see if I could just come in and pick up the mobile order and they said no I would still have to wait in the line in the drive-through. So what should‚Äôve only taken 5 to 10 minutes ended up taking 30 minutes. The app did not say anything about mobile orders being unable to be picked up
"Recently I placed a mobile order in hopes of using the offer for $3 off of any order over $15. I proceeded to place everything that I wanted on the app, just to put in my card info in and the order to go straight through with no offer even being applied. Forcing me to pay the full amount which I can say was way over $15. There wasn‚Äôt even an option to redeem this offer, it‚Äôs like I couldn‚Äôt even tap on it to be applied but I clearly seen it in front of my eyes. Long story I was played out of my money and on top of that they don‚Äôt even have an option for no ice in a drink.. come on Wendy‚Äôs. I‚Äôm really disappointed."
"I use this app on a regular basis because I‚Äôm pretty much addicted to the frosty-ccinos (by the way can you add an option for extra frosty in these please). Unfortunately I occasionally have issues when I‚Äôm ordering, I get error messages and I‚Äôm unable to place a mobile order. Aside from that I love placing orders and racking up points. Wendy‚Äôs is my favorite fast food restaurant and if the glitches in the app would get fixed I would give it 5 stars!"
"this app has time and time again disappointed me. ive redownloaded a total of 4 times and each time there has been an issue.

1. nothing loads, the moment i open a cart up it deletes everything

2. app works fine for a while then suddenly deletes my account and all points associated. customer service is unresponsive

3. same problem as number one

4. today. i place a delivery order for a few items and only receive my drink. i can not dispute the purchase from my card for 3-10 business days unless wendys responds first. 

i wait on hold both on call and the ‚Äúyoure the first one in line‚Äù screen for TWO HOURS with no response from either side and eventually have to give up, as im at work and just wanted some breakfast.

tldr;
this app is faulty and clearly wendys doesnt care about customers, but cares more about making a quick buck from having an app. still havent received my money back. will never download again."
"I tried to sign up in the app and add a password. The app said my password strength was ‚Äòawesome,‚Äô after three other password tries that all met the criteria and I got an error message each time after the birthday ask that said my password didn‚Äôt meet the criteria. I cannot figure out how to get past that! I let the app win and didn‚Äôt use it to order my food today. I have tried to use it in the past and had issues. Many other places have great apps that I don‚Äôt have to fight to get credit for ordering. I would think Wendys should be able to do the same. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
"The app itself is fairly straightforward to navigate and use. The sticking point comes when it‚Äôs time to enter payment. I can either enter my credit card info every time or store my credit card info where the security is uncertain (and then I‚Äôm asked to enter my CVV which defeats the convenience of saving my card info).

The solution is very simple: add an Apple Pay option for payment. Simplicity, convenience, and security already built in and I don‚Äôt have to juggle my phone and my card when ordering."
"Pros:
1) Mobile orders and payment have gone through fine for me.
2) Offers/discounts have also worked, ‚Äúsaving‚Äù me money.
3) Ordering has been fairly simple.

Cons:
1) Most importantly, the app needs to allow you to remotely check-in. Putting in a mobile order, but still having to wait 15-30 minutes after ‚Äúchecking-in‚Äù at the restaurant completely negates the use of the application. Why would I order ahead just so I can wait the same amount of time?!?!?! Makes zero sense. For large orders this is a no brained. Multiple times I have presented ahead and my order gets ‚Äúprepared fresh.‚Äù Great, by I ordered ahead so I didn‚Äôt have to wait in the parking lot for someone to bring my food out to me. I ordered ahead so I could arrive, grab the big bag of food at the drive-thru window, and be on my way. Please, fix this. Thanks."
"Love that Wendy‚Äôs has an app with great offers and rewards! Only thing I dislike is having to have the employee scan my phone when going thru the drive thru. When the restaurant is busy it seems to be an inconvenience for the employee, wish they would think of another way to do that but overall enjoy the app and definitely have increased our trips to Wendy‚Äôs because of it. üòÄ"
"This app is easy to use and convenient.  It is easy to use coupons because they‚Äôre right there in the app.  There are always deals!  It‚Äôs super fast and convenient and highly accurate to my orders.  I totally recommend it.  I normally don‚Äôt do reviews or use apps to purchase things because it usually makes me spend more money, but I write this review to share with you how awesome I think this is."
"Why can‚Äôt I see what‚Äôs in my bag before I complete the order?  Why can‚Äôt I use the offers on the app for a mobile order? Why do I get an error when I go to check out after I‚Äôve spent 20 minutes trying to place an order??

In 2020, a well designed app is essential for businesses.  The best deals should be available for mobile purchases because it minimizes contact during a pandemic.  I‚Äôve tried multiple times to use the Wendy‚Äôs app and ended up going down the street to somewhere with an easy to use app.  Chick fil a has it figured out... chipotle has it figured out... even McD‚Äôs isn‚Äôt bad.  The Wendy‚Äôs app gives me rage."
"I can get into the app upon a fresh download just fine. That is, right up until I hit ‚ÄúOrder.‚Äù Once that happens, the gates of Hell open apparently. I get to the spot where I can choose my location, and then once I select it the app crashes as it loads the menu. Every subsequent attempt to get back into the app is an immediate crash. I can delete the app and reupload it to get back in, but every time I select a location to order from, the cycle begins anew. It‚Äôs kind of funny actually that despite working well for most others around me, it just bugs out on my phone. But doesn‚Äôt make for a good app. One star."
When they updated the wendys app and made the other version obsolete that waa the end to my access. I used foe myself and grandkids a lot as Wendys  favorite   fast food place  and best deals. My I phone not support the new app as an i phone 7. This is disturbing to me as I cannot gi out and  buy a newer phone. I live on SS and a small retirement monthly check thank you for chance to give input.
"I NEVER rate apps because i never have so many issues I would rate this 0 stars for the utter failure of an app this is. Trying to place an online order and all the way at the end after I have to click to allow wendys to store my card information I get told my card information is incorrect. I use my card on every online store, app and never have an issue. Wendys is a first and a last. I tried to help the order taker out by ordering ahead of time but 
The companies failed attempt of an app does not allow it. And you cant use the website because it does not allow you to customize your order."
"So I got this app just to get the 6 piece spicey nuggets for free and when I put all my information it all clears..... So I'm like ""whatever"" so I put it all in again and I go to place orders and it kept getting error after error and after so much I got annoyed and removed the app and decided to look at reviews and it seems that most of the 5 star reviews seem to be botted so I think a lot of the 5 star reviews are fake because the negative reviews seemed to have the same issues as me if not, similar,  so I wouldn't expect much from this app when downloading it folks."
"I just wanted to order some breakfast for pick up. i started trying to order around 9:50am, it took 15 minutes because it kept clearing my order, i dont know why. but when i finally got to the payment none of the options would accept my debit card, i triple checked the numbers and even switched the  locations a few times before getting fed up and just calling (around 10:22 at this point) the store to order over the phone, which the staff who picked up said i had to be there or the call would hold up the line. the app did not work and i ended up eating some where else"
"Had an overall awful experience using the app. It forces the user to always allow the app to track the phones location for pick up, then after manually clicked ‚Äúim here‚Äù, it didn‚Äôt save my order or order details, no email, nothing, so i had a back and forth with the Wendy‚Äôs clerk since he couldn‚Äôt see my name in the mobile order list, which turns out it was showing my name initials on the order and not my full first or last name. had 4 people order and get their order right in front of me before they even started making the app order..."
"Marketing would leas one to believe that is easy to communicate with Wendy‚Äôs corporate customer service - however that is far from the truth. The below pattern has been consistent for the past year:
- Emails ignored
- Messages to the website ignored
- Twitter ignored
- Phone always busy

‚Äî-
Today I had the privilege of actually getting a ringtone to which lead to an hour weight listening to commercials about Wendy‚Äôs adoption program. After an hour an agent picks up the phone but does not speak and puts the call on my on silent hold for about 20 minutes before the call disconnected. 

Trying to submit a form now on the Wendy‚Äôs website is impossible answer is always an error that states the date selected cannot be in the future -regardless of the date that‚Äôs chosen.

‚Äî-
Item for Apple - there is a bug when using the keyboard slider writing a review crashes and everything gets deleted -  happened several times now."
"I ordered a large order of fries from the app and paid for it. Got in my car and went to the store to pick them up. When i got there the kid in the window told me they were out of fries and couldn‚Äôt give me a refund because I ordered from the app. I‚Äôve been trying for DAYS to contact someone; the live chat is dead, the messages i send are never received and the phone line has had me on hold for a total of 4 hours this week without getting to anyone. Do yourself a favor and don‚Äôt use this garbage. I‚Äôm only here because NO ONE EVER REFUNDED ME FOR MY ORDER and can‚Äôt find any other way to complain. Awful service, awful app."
"I used to frequent Wendy‚Äôs until they felt the need to add the gps feature in their app. This is a terrible decision because it makes picking up food worse than just ordering in the drive thru. The stupid app kept telling me I‚Äôm not at Wendy‚Äôs, even though I was. I even turned on my WiFi, didn‚Äôt help. I didn‚Äôt want to close the app and reopen it because I thought my order would disappear. Well guess what happened anyway. My order magically vanished from the app, despite the funds leaving my bank account. And of course my local Wendy‚Äôs is clueless to have ever received an order. Screw Wendy‚Äôs Dave is dumb"
"The ordering process is needlessly complicated, we can‚Äôt even customize a drink order to not have ice added. On top of that, the app doesn‚Äôt always send orders through to the stores on time. As I‚Äôm writing this, I‚Äôve been waiting fifteen minutes to have three drinks brought out to curbside. When I double checked the order to make sure I placed it at the correct store, the time stamp shows it was only submitted about two minutes ago, so this isn‚Äôt a store employee fault. Do better."
"Ordering in this app is never straightforward. It‚Äôs fraught with bugs. Sometimes, I add an item and the app doesn‚Äôt recognize it. The burger will sit in checkout costing 0.00. I‚Äôll have to restart my order and hope the issue doesn‚Äôt happen again. Today, I was trying to apply a coupon for a free fry with purchase. I had other items in my cart but the offer keeps giving me an error message telling me to add something. I literally never write reviews, but this happens every time I use this app and I needed to put it out there. One of the most frustrating fast food apps I‚Äôve used, frankly."
"So I eat at Wendy‚Äôs everyday, I scan the app and get points every day I go to redeem some bc I‚Äôm short on cash come to find out I have no points, I don‚Äôt remember reading points expire or anything do I really have to babysit for my points that‚Äôs lame and bad business, even my transaction history is empty my co worker said the same thing happened to him the restaurants know they have to give out free food so there just pretending to scan hoping you forget, just like credit card company‚Äôs they tell you every 100 checks shred one so we can make the late fees I will delete the app and go somewhere else if Wendy‚Äôs can‚Äôt be fair with me"
"I have several restaurant apps only phone. Yet Wendy‚Äôs is the only one that I constantly have to reset my password & it still doesn‚Äôt allow me to access the offers or any category. I‚Äôm sure it is something I‚Äôm doing but regardless it is clearly not user friendly to those of us that are tech challenged. Y‚Äôall should really consider consulting ChickFilA. There app is so easy, user friendly & it allows you to load a gift card so that there is money in the app for mobile orders. There are people like me who prefer to use cash & not credit cards or debit cards. 
Thanks for your time & attention to this detail."
"I have tried using this app intermittently for the last 3 months.  I have successfully placed and paid for one order.  Unfortunately, I was charged twice for that order and had to have the erroneous charge returned by the credit card company.  Since that time, I have been unable to pay for any orders.  The app keeps saying ‚Äúplease check your credit card information.  Contact your card provider for more information.‚Äù  I have tried multiple credit cards and have had no success.  Please fix the app so that payments can be made or delete the app until you are able to do so."
"I ordered delivery from the app around 1:12am and was given an est of 24 mins. However it took way longer than that just to get a driver. just for it to have the driver ‚Äúarriving at store‚Äù for 5 mins before completely reverting back to order received. The driver left at 1:51am meaning he went to the window and they probably just claimed they were close when they close at 2am.  Now I can cancel the order, which i should be able too. And i also can‚Äôt ask for customer help or get refund for food, i didn‚Äôt even get, through the app"
"I had to have my iPhone replaced recently under warranty and when I got the new one, I have never been able to login to my Windys app. My saved password comes up but it will not work. I have a balance on my app that I obtain via a gift card. Every time I try to login, it says bad request. I even uninstalled the app and reinstalled it. Same thing! This has to be the worst fast food app ever!My money is being held hostage and I can‚Äôt do anything about it not to mention I cannot access my points or any coupons/deals. Fix this Wendy‚Äôs! This app is horrible! Go back to the old format. It worked great."
"I had got a free breakfast sandwich from a app and applied it to an order but still had to pay for delivery, so after a while I get a call from my deliver saying that when he went into the Wendy‚Äôs they said my order didn‚Äôt say what I order so he tried to text customer support and they said that they would cancel my order and i fine with that until my money never came back into my account and after a few days they complete my transaction for food that I never got but honestly I could press charges or make a complaint but I hope this can be resolved easily"
"I
Paid for my order on mobile pay but the restaurant said they didn‚Äôt have the order. I have the receipt but did not get the food.  I tried calling 888 number but was placed on hold and never got an answer. Was the amount for today deducted from my digital account? So I used the offer, have receipt but received no food."
"First the app says would you like to open me with your finger print?. Of course that doesn‚Äôt work as is so often the case, so I enter my passcode which then asks me if I want to use my saved password for Wendy‚Äôs but the saved password doesn‚Äôt work. So I chose the password reset option. I then go to my e mail and the reset link doesn‚Äôt work (but the link to Wendy‚Äôs.com in the e mail works just fine). Now who is going to continue to put up with this much trouble from an app he uses on an infrequent basis? Not me! You‚Äôve lost sales from me. Do you folks actually test your apps? Like the way your customers use them?"
"I would rather give no stars. T-Mobile prompted me to get the app to use a T-Mobile Tuesday reward.  The Wendy‚Äôs app is a complete failure. Can‚Äôt even set up a new account without issues. Tried with a different email to give it another chance‚Äîno luck.  Tried the actual website for Wendy‚Äôs hoping to make a ‚ÄúRewards‚Äù account that way and then log in via the app. The website doesn‚Äôt even work properly.  I get that Wendy‚Äôs is in the food business; not IT, but if you are going to offer modern tech options hire someone capable of making it function correctly (or at least function at all)."
"It doesn‚Äôt work. You can input your order just fine, but good luck getting it to accept your payment. I‚Äôve tried to submit orders over a dozen different times. Once... ONCE it actually went through. I use apps to place orders for my work crew almost daily. Only get this app if you want to spend a lot of time inputting the order and then never being able to actually place the order. Don‚Äôt worry with uninstalling and reinstalling the app. That doesn‚Äôt help. Hey Wendy‚Äôs: if you‚Äôre going to put an app out, please make sure it works. Otherwise it just wastes time and pisses your customers off."
"I ordered food through the app. I was parked at the location, walked up to go in to get my food and the dinning room doors were locked. The sign outside said it was open. The drive thru line was backed all the way around the building and out to the street. I walked up to the window and was told my order was not ready. From the placing the order till the time I left it was 40 mins! I did not receive my food and I asked for a refund. I was told I had to do it through the app. Well that‚Äôs funny there is no way to do it. I will no longer use this app. I have gotten no where with the restaurant or the district manager."
"The first time I placed an order the app did not notify the store so when I got there I had to wait for the store to cook everything and it took 15 mins. The next time I used the app the breakfast menu was not available at my nearby store, the only stores I could order from were 30 miles plus. I called the store and there were currently serving breakfast. The last and final time I tried using the app when I tried placing an order for breakfast the app stated you just missed breakfast, all breakfast orders must be placed by 1025am how does lunch sound? The time was 930am. Too many problems with the app so I deleted this app!"
"With the stay at home order for now with the corona virus. My husband went and got us our dinner. I have never had a problem with this Wendy‚Äôs ever. But this time I got cold and old fries. I could not eat them. My husband ordered a baconator and bacon cheese burger. They were not right. And cold. They give us a bacon cheeseburger and a cheese burger. The baconator shows two cheeseburgers and bacon. So I was very disappointed in my dinner this time. I hope they get better. Should of had fresh fries. I didn‚Äôt get a receipt with my order. So I can‚Äôt give you the number of the store. It is the one in South Zanesville, in Ohio. Thank you I hope they get better."
"No support for Apple Pay. The app is not even capable of scanning a credit card with the devices camera. These are features competitors apps have added months or in many cases years ago. Additionally, I also ordered once and when I showed up the restaurant was closed (middle of the day). How can the app even allow ordering from a restaurant that is not even own? The only good thing about the app is it is great at providing customization. It makes it clear what is included and what has been customized."
"I have show the barcode to the cashier 15+/- times and they scan it before I pay but I have only had reward points upload twice. 
Sometimes the cashiers look at me weird when I show it for them to scan but there is clearly signage that advertises this app posted.
My stores are not open for dining so I cannot use mobile order. 
It‚Äôs frustrating that the rewards don‚Äôt work and when I decided to cash in the little reward I earned it didn‚Äôt work again. So I cashed in my points and the app took my reward but the cashier said nothing came through. 
This app needs work."
"Why would the app let me place a mobile order with a coupon in the cart if I didn‚Äôt add the item manually after having adding the coupon. I didn‚Äôt know I needed to do that, seems unnecessary, and it placed the order anyways. No warning that there‚Äôs a coupon without the item on the coupon. Thanks didn‚Äôt want my free fries anyways. And of course the worker couldn‚Äôt just give me the side of fries I would have had to make another purchase. First time in a long time ordering Wendy‚Äôs and probably the last. Oh and they don‚Äôt have Apple Pay, definitely the last."
"Wendy‚Äôs is awesome and I love to order breakfast or order ahead on my lunch break. Rewards are excellent and easy to redeem. Delivery is a cheaper option than Grubhub/DoorDash pricing 

Problem is that it usually takes me forever to actually order via the app. It will often crash entirely so I have to delete and re-download the app, and maybe 1 of every three orders will run into an error screen before I can process payment. Errors are very generic, so I don‚Äôt know if the store is closed or delivery is not offered or if it‚Äôs an app or payment issue. 

Good food, good rewards, horrible app experience."
"I‚Äôve used the app numerous times, but I‚Äôm about to give up and head to other restaurants. More than once I‚Äôve thought I applied a deal, but got to the drive-thru and discovered it wasn‚Äôt applied. If I select a deal, I should be prompted to select the items for the deal *right there*. Also the app is not updated in a timely manner when deals expire. This morning I looked at the app and expected a ‚Äúbuy 1, get one for $1‚Äù but only found out at the drive-thru that the deal was over. üôÅ Really?"
"There are some flaws, such as missing menu items. For some reason, the ENTIRE breakfast category has disappeared as an option on my app, yet remains on my two roommates apps?? (It's currently 9:33am so I know breakfast is currently being served and this has been an ongoing issue). Another thing I've noticed is that drinks are missing. I love sweet tea, but the app only allows me to select the unsweetened version because there is no sweet option to select."
"We decided to order from Wendys today because my husband had an errand to run next door.  The app automatically told Wendys that my husband was there while he was running his errand.  This meant that he had to go into the store because they had already given up looking for his car by the time he actually arrived.  Also, the frostys had melted while sitting around.  And when he got home and we looked at the order, they had ignored all the customization I had asked for, including the salad dressing which is a required customization when ordering a salad."
"I placed a mobile order so that it would be faster so that I could get to work on time because the customers are usually wrapped around the building twice. 

Well I get here and realized I still have to sit in the long ridiculous line because they don‚Äôt bring the food out to you. 

Now not only can‚Äôt I go somewhere else that‚Äôs faster before work, but ill be late for work because I had to purchase it with a credit card when placing it online and I‚Äôm not giving up my money for the food if I drive-off. 

This mobile ordering online is stupid if you have to still wait in the line.

UPDATE: I was extremely late for work and my food was cold because it had apparently been sitting on the counter the whole 45 minutes I waited in line. Never again. Never."
"I used the app to place a huge order at work. Go to check out on a $100+ order and it had NOTHING in the cart and would not let me add anything. Spent a hour deleting app, reinstalling and placing orders again only for same thing to happen two more times.  Tried on another persons app and same thing. Went to Chic Fil A instead that day. Decided to give a shot again tonight and surprise surprise exact same thing ya happened. Won‚Äôt waste my time again. Hate giving a one star rating or bad review but how you gonna have a app for mobile orders when it Does not work?"
"The app works great and it is very easy to order food. However, a few features would make this a 5 star app:

1. Apple Pay. There is no Apple Pay feature and you are only allowed to save one card at a time.

2. Coca-cola freestyle option for restaurants that have it. If you want a drink that is not listed on the app, you need to request it at the restaurant. A no ice option would be nice as well."
"Let‚Äôs start here, nobody in your stores knows how to use these apps. Manager even told me on more than one occasion they don‚Äôt really know a lot about the app. 

Not aloud to use earned rewards and the frosty key tag in the same order but yet I paid for both of those items but I can‚Äôt get them on the same order -which is likely the reason I lose points, it‚Äôs too complicated to use them. 

Tonight was a perfect example, tried to use 700 points for a salad and I‚Äôve followed the complicated steps to get those points loaded to my card and yet it didn‚Äôt load and when they scanned my barcode I needed to pay for the salad and still lost my 700 points. 

I think your app causes you to lose money because managers are gracious enough to comp certain items. 

I could probably find a high school student to rewrite your app, let me know, I have connections‚Ä¶or ask Starbucks, they seem to have worked out the kinks."
"If you don‚Äôt continuously get an error message trying to get in, no matter what you change to correct the issue, you‚Äôll constantly be trapped in loading screens and broken buttons that either do nothing or take so long to do something it times out the request.
Def needs a lot of repairs and updates. My big thoughts on wildly broken websites or apps is; If you can‚Äôt trust it to do it‚Äôs job properly you probably also can‚Äôt trust the security of it. 
I don‚Äôt recommend using the app until updates are implemented to the functionality as a /minimum/ standard."
"Half the time, they say they don‚Äôt have the order, even though my credit card has already been charged.

Once, they claimed I had to have ordered it for a different Wendy‚Äôs location, even though the app showed their address. They denied it was their address, even after I showed them on Apple Maps that it was their address. Then another employee chimed in and said that they had already given my order to someone else, which is why they couldn‚Äôt find the mobile order.

I don‚Äôt expect fast food employees to be geniuses, but it seems if half the time they can‚Äôt successfully fulfill a simple order, I‚Äôm not going to take the risk anymore. I‚Äôd rather your employees just be someone else‚Äôs problem.

I‚Äôve submitted feedback to Wendy‚Äôs through the app on several occasions, but they never respond. I don‚Äôt think they care."
"I am a person with cash only who is trying to order food. I don‚Äôt have a card or Apple Pay because my I don‚Äôt work and my parents doesn‚Äôt let me have an account. A lot of apps don‚Äôt do cash which is wierd because people like me then can‚Äôt order food and I can‚Äôt go and pick it up cause I‚Äôm 15. If someone was home I‚Äôd ask them to order food for me. But since it‚Äôs just me and my sis, who is the same age as me, and both of us doesn‚Äôt have an account or Apple Pay, we can‚Äôt have any food. Now we are gonna have to make some, which is fine, but I came home at 5 pm from school, almost 10 hours. I‚Äôm not complaining, but I‚Äôm really tired and wasted literally an hour trying to find apps that let me pay with cash and found nothing. 
Please consider letting costumers pay with cash as an option."
"Let me start off by saying how much I do appreciate panda express being open during these uncertain times, with that being said I‚Äôve got to say that for the prices they charge they certainly try to short you as much as possible. I have gotten the same thing every time ever since panda express opened in Michigan city and I‚Äôve never had an issue until they have done the carry out orders only. I order a large orange chicken only and when I brought it to the point of them not filling it up the whole way I always get an excuse or they try to explain to me they only fill it up to the line which is OK if that‚Äôs what was happening but that‚Äôs not what was happening and I‚Äôve pointed out multiple times and yet I still get treated like I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking about or that I am wrong. I‚Äôm not very appreciative of the disrespect or lack of caring about making sure that the container is simply filled to where they say it should be to begin with. For the pricing that panda express charges I can certainly receive better quality and quantity both from the food and the customer appreciation elsewhere. Very disappointed to say the least. I‚Äôd like to say that it would matter that I made this post but I am almost certain it will not make any difference sincerely a very disappointed combat Army veteran."
"This app has way more stars than it deserves. I don‚Äôt know how so many people are satisfied with this completely unusable app. I cannot order anything because every time I initiate an order by setting the pickup time and place, it just loads for a long time before telling me the order could not be placed. The loading times for anything in this app are nonsensical and absurd. I have to force quit the app then open it again to start over and hopefully it doesn‚Äôt get stuck on a loading screen again. Why the hell does it take so long to continue as guest? Like wth is it processing for so long to get past the initial screen? I can‚Äôt fast log in because autofilling the email always enters my password (which is fully visible i.e. security issue) instead of my email. Even when I have the cursor on the password field, autofilling it will replace my manually entered email with my password (again, it is visible) and still leave the password field blank. Also the map to find your location almost never works and also takes forever to load. This app has all the same terrible problems as their website too. Unbelievable that they screwed up such an important part of what could have been an excellent addition to their business model both on desktop and mobile."
"Wow. To start off, my order was messed up by the store so I had to call and they gave me store credit. They would‚Äôt cover my delivery fee which was absurd, I paid to have it delivered. ANYWAYS, I try to reorder on the app and it says the order couldn‚Äôt be placed because now it would be ready at a later time which was fine but it still wouldn‚Äôt go through. If you read other reviews, others have the same experience. I kept having that issue no matter what I tried on the app, so I finally went on my laptop and just ordered from their website. That‚Äôs how I ordered the first time. Tell me why, 4 ORDERS WERE MADE. 3 were from the unsuccessful attempts on the app, and 1 successful try from the website. I got three orders and then ANOTHER ONE WAS ON THE WAY. Thankfully that one was cancelled, someone must‚Äôve figured out what happened. I didn‚Äôt call the store, pretty sure it wasn‚Äôt their fault. And during these uncertain times, I am sure there is no one to call. But yea spending so much money on Panda was not in my plans today. So if you don‚Äôt want this to be your experience, refrain from the app. Just use the website. It‚Äôll literally save you money. And FIX THIS APP !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"I drove to the restaurant, but there was a sign that they were no longer offering the family deal for $20 at the restaurant. Manager made me drive around and order from the app or online while in the parking lot. Then I advised to workers that were taking out the track that neither the app or online were offering the family deal. She recommend I try to call their corporate office. EXCUSE ME!!! That‚Äôs not my problem, that‚Äôs a Panda problem. So I drove back through the drive thru and asked to speak to the manager. They had me wait at the window while she was on the phone and then when she came to the window she said they had to reset the app and the options online. I closed the app on my phone, reopened it and voila, guess what the option was added. Unfortunately, instead of the manager taking my order at that time as a courtesy for the inconvenience, she told to go back around to the parking lot, place my order on the app and wait for the time given for it to be ready. 30 minute wait. In the meantime, I watched a countless number of cars drive in and out of the panda drive thru. This experience sucked!!!"
"I‚Äôve tried on several occasions to order using the app and it‚Äôs always a mess.  I only order the Family Pack and a few sides.  But when I select ‚ÄúPlace Order‚Äù it bounces and never completes the order.  I think it‚Äôs because the Family Pack can‚Äôt be completed in the pick-up time allowed.  No one at the store has an answer.  And when I called to see if the order had gone through the lady said it usually takes 10-15 minutes for online orders to post on the store‚Äôs system ‚Äúso call back in 10-15 minutes‚Äù.  We love Panda.  Please fix you app, your communication system, or your process."
Went to order the family meal to go online and went to pick up at 54 and Little where they have two separate lines one for order pick up and one for immediate orders. The pick up line had 10 people and not moving for an hour. I wAited that long because I was early and thinking I‚Äôd get my food.  I didn‚Äôt wait anymore to get it. No one was moving.  They were making orders for people that weren‚Äôt waiting in line.  The two people ahead of me were waiting over an hour.  They were busy inside but not handing out the food to the people that were there. I did not pick up my food. I couldn‚Äôt get someone to come over to the immediate order side to cancel my order. So I left. I‚Äôve called 4x to cancel.  No answer. A manager should have come out and said what was going on.  Either they had a huge order to fulfill and they were backed up and someone should have come outside to say something.  No communication at all. I understand things are different in the world now but customer service should not have changed.
"So I ordered a delivery order in the app and was told it would be delivered at 12:09. I got a text from DoorDash, that my delivery was confirmed. In the Panda Express app there was no mention of a 3rd party delivery service. I waited until 12:10, looked at tracking and they updated the delivery time to 12:33. I was a bit annoyed, but okay, those things happen. At 12:30 I got a text that the order had been delivered and it certainly wasn‚Äôt.  I looked at all my neighbors front doors just to make sure that the order wasn‚Äôt mistakenly delivered to the wrong address. Then I called the store and was told that they had no responsibility for this since it‚Äôs a 3rd party delivery company. I was shocked. So I said it is your app, I didn‚Äôt order through a different app, and they told me too bad. Since I had already paid for it I begged for them to make it again and my husband would pick it up. They agreed, but reluctantly. So frustrating and sad that this company works this way."
Approximately pick up times are horrible if you are setting up a pick up time it‚Äôs for a specific reason. I had placed an order and I had arrived to the restaurant way before my pick up time however I had seen a bad just sitting there for the whole time that I was sitting there waiting. When a minute before the pick up time comes around I go up to the door and wait and I told them my name and they gave me the bag that was sitting there for at least 15min I let it slide next time around same thing happens not to mention that it‚Äôs sitting there and food gets cold so then I ordered and got there 7 min after I placed the ordered and then they are telling me that the order won‚Äôt be ready until that certain time well then I told them to please let me know because I don‚Äôt want cold food... mind you that it‚Äôs the same store they need  to be more consistent
"It‚Äôs a great concept. He walk in and pick up your food you can leave. I stood there for five minutes after I said it was supposed to be done. No one asked my name.

I continue to watch and saw that what appeared to be my food was sitting there at the end of the line, not under any heat lamps or anything. And after seven minutes someone finally checked to see what the name of it was and it was mine. I said do you mean to tell me that my food has been sitting there for more than seven minutes. I didn‚Äôt think I was being evil when I strongly suggested that they can give me fresh food. The food had been sitting there prior to my coming in. 

The time I spent going into the store I could‚Äôve easily gone through drive-through. I won‚Äôt be using it again and I will be deleting the app."
"Ordered in the app and they won‚Äôt let me pick a time less than 30 minutes away. Get there and they don‚Äôt have our order. Then they tell us they don‚Äôt get it till 10 minutes before pick up. I ask if I can cancel and she tells me know and because I am on a different time zone it will be an hour longer. She acted like the app was the worst way to order but we were on the go and didn‚Äôt know how busy they were...they were dead so not sure why they couldn‚Äôt fill the order in a timely manner. And yes, you can cancel if they haven‚Äôt accepted or processed. App also can‚Äôt handle time zones at all. This isn‚Äôt the first time this has happened just the most fustrating since we live on the time zone line and they can‚Äôt process an order at all. App would be wonderful if the employees actually understood it."
"I often order from this store and every time I come to this place I am always disgusted at the level of service that they DO NOT give you here. Every time I go in they do not greet you, smile, or even look at you. Even the manager was there and doesn‚Äôt greet or acknowledge me, and he even looked right at me , and NOTHING! Many times I try to give them the benefit of the doubt and I will smile and say hello, say please and thank you and I do not get any reply back. Also they don‚Äôt seem to get my order right. By the time I get home they always seem to have something wrong with one or all of the order  If it wasn‚Äôt for the convenience I would never come back and believe me I spend a lot of money into this establishment. But if they don‚Äôt get it together I will inconvenience myself and go further to get the food ."
"The app visually looks good and well put together. That‚Äôs it‚Äôs only plus. It‚Äôs hard to add a payment method, it insisted the card number for most of my cards is not right despite my own triple checking. I found a single card that works and proceeded to order. Only six entree options were listed, if the rest were there they were not easy to find- I searched for a while. If they were the only ones listed because they were out of the others I‚Äôm annoyed because I would‚Äôve chosen to wait and order something else when it was ready. After ordering we had to wait fifteen minutes for the order to even be processed BEFORE they‚Äôd make it for us. Panda Express is one of my favorite resteraunts but this app is definitely deterring me from coming back."
I mean overall it‚Äôs a okay app right but you place your order and it takes forever for it to arrive. I went into the restaurant just 10 mins before it was due and the restaurant staff didn‚Äôt care if I showed mobile receipt or order number ‚Äúas long as it hasn‚Äôt appeared on my end I can‚Äôt do anything about it ‚Äú and i had to wait for my order to appear  on their screen . While the staff was really frustrated that I couldn‚Äôt just wait 15 mins when I simply just wanted my food . I didn‚Äôt argue back . I waited and the order came in and they‚Äôre like NOW it‚Äôs your turn . When I had ppl come in much after I did and received their order first .unlike the Chick-Fil- A  app that has the option to tell them ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here ‚Äú so they can start working on it . The earliest you can get it is like 30-50 mins after you order . Just skip the app and wait in line .
"The app is fairly well thought out, but several times it‚Äôs given me an error when I try to submit my order. No rhyme or reason. This creates a problem when, say, the only way to take advantage of a special is to order online.

Also, what makes the app insufficient is mainly what‚Äôs missing. One is the option to pay cash at the restaurant. Also, while there‚Äôs an ‚ÄúI‚Äôm running late‚Äù button, there‚Äôs no ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre running late‚Äù button. In fact, there‚Äôs no apparent resolution mechanism for when you‚Äôre waiting there, say, 10+ minutes past your pickup time, which seems to happen a lot at my local Panda.
So, they‚Äôre happy to take your money but not so anxious to resolve any hiccups."
"I recently moved from the Bay Area to Modesto - and eventual bought a home in Newman. I love my new home and Newman - but by the 2nd week of living in Newman - I realized that there were NO restaurants here in the West Valley that serve any Asiatic Cuisine! I panicked and went through Sushi and Kimchee withdrawals for 6 weeks / until I stumbled upon this Asiatic Oasis in this Burger-centric Desert that I now call home.

I historically order Pickup via the App - and in each and every ordering episode - they get it RIGHT - they have READY ON-TIME - and the quality is ALWAYS consistent - and best of all you get your monies worth!!! 

So thank you again Panda Express Patterson - your effort‚Äôs in delivering healthy and delicious food - that is both pleasing to the eyes and the palette."
"At the Lima rd restaurant in Fort Wayne Indiana as I write this review. My confirmed order was supposed to be ready for a 6:10 pm pickup. I arrived at 6:11. Took 6 minutes for anyone to acknowledge me even though I was the only one in the Online Ordering pickup line. When I finally got waited on, my online order wasn‚Äôt found. I was told it wasn‚Äôt their fault and I needed to produce a receipt. After retrieving my phone from my car, I returned to the Online Ordering line. Again, waited over five minutes without any staff (including the cashier) acknowledging my presence. I finally asked the cashier if she could check on my order. She fetched another employee. I showed him my phone order and he did fill the order. Ended up waiting a total of 25 minutes after my scheduled pick up time for my order to be ready. No apologies.
Really bad customer service."
"I was buying food for my office team, but when I realized it would take an hour to get ready I decided not to order and cancel. I never hit confirm. A few hours later I get notified I have a pending charge on my card of $170 (what I was buying was less then 50). I called the local restaurant that I ordered the food from and the manager couldn‚Äôt find a transaction or where this was coming from. I then called corporate where they could not explain to me where or why I got this charge. He almost acted like it was very normal. Even after I confirmed and double check to make sure I‚Äôd never actually finalized the order. Needles to say I am astonished that such a well known large establishment could 1.) ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù take this much money from my account without me ever actually placing the order 2.) acting like it wasn‚Äôt a big deal."
"The costumer service and the app themselves I would rate at least a 4. But the system they set up is weird. Twice now I put for a pick up ‚ÄúASAP‚Äù. I wait in my car for ten minutes then go in to see if my food is ready. But apparently the app tells the workers that the order is made for 15 mins later then when I walk in. I‚Äôm guessing 30 mins from when I made the order. That wouldn‚Äôt really be a problem if they could just make my food then since no one is there. But they can‚Äôt because the app hasn‚Äôt released the order. So they don‚Äôt know what I order and can‚Äôt confirm I paid. Ok. So let me cancel so I can order normally‚Ä¶ nope. Cant do that either. So, I‚Äôm standing there looking at the workers do other things. Not making my food or anything. Just, wow."
"Just ate my food. Yuk and yuk. First off, I mobile ordered and for the second time out of two times I‚Äôve done this, my order was not ready. Not only was it not ready, the ticket was still in the machine. There was one other customer in the place so I don‚Äôt know what the issue was. I honestly could have walked in and ordered and payed faster than it took her to figure out the ticket. She seemed frazzled that I was two minutes early and reminded me that my order said it wouldn‚Äôt be ready until 9:25. It was 9:23. Anyway got home and ate my food. Gross!  Mind you I have kids so we‚Äôve gotten this good many times before but I‚Äôm pretty sure they cooked the food so much that the actual chicken disintegrated. It was primarily fried coating. Did I say gross??  This may be my last trip. It‚Äôs unhealthy anyway. That being said, the veggies were pretty  good."
"I can‚Äôt say how much I love our Panda Express. The employees are always pleasant and kind. My only negative is not for our store but for the corporate office. Please expand our Panda Express they deserve more. Get them a Flag Store, same area but a flag store. This property generates a lot of business for you so you can do this. Also do not change the management there she‚Äôs ( sorry I don‚Äôt know her name at this time, just can‚Äôt think of it, apologies) always on top of everything in that store. So happy to have that store there please don‚Äôt lose the quality. Thank you for listening to my rant."
"I like using the app to order, it makes things fast & convenient. However, it‚Äôs frustrating that all drink options are not listed in the app. It‚Äôs nice that they prepare the drinks for you, except when I want an option that‚Äôs not offered on the app (passion tea), then I‚Äôm forced to now drink something different (or pull a jerk move & dump and refill right there in front of the workers). I understand if you can‚Äôt give all the options, like if some stores are different than others or whatever, but you should have an option of just ‚Äòfountain drink‚Äô & let people fill it themselves."
"The new app may be ‚Äúeasier‚Äù to use, but NOTHING is saved from the previous versions profile.  Even logging in with my account, of which I‚Äôve ordered many times, nothing is saved.  It says I have no ‚Äúprevious orders.‚Äù  Every time I‚Äôve ordered in the past, there are 7 of us, and their orders are unique and specific.  Instead of simply being able to click ‚Äúreorder‚Äù and be done, I have to go through the entire process again.  While I appreciate the fresh look and friendly UI, it‚Äôs useless to me if my profile can‚Äôt migrate over with the new app!!  Sigh."
"Ordered pick-up and when my order was ready, I stood at the pick-up door for almost 10 minutes while the employees inside looked at me and ignored me. One employee even went outside to tend to a drive-thru customer. She simply walked past me twice without even greeting me or telling me that I would be attended shortly or EVEN LOOKED AT ME. I was ignored and got stupid looks from the employees. If they noticed me, why didn‚Äôt anyone approach me? If you‚Äôre going to hire anyone that unprofessional, make sure they at least have the potential and capacity to learn how to deliver GREAT customer service if it‚Äôs not going to be excellent. I don‚Äôt recommend this app as it has a delayed response and makes ordering take longer and delivery difficult for the employees."
"On Mother‚Äôs Day, wanted to order the $20 family special. The web says online is not available at the Swan/Grant location, web says it was open till 8:30, got there at 6:30,  saw a note on the door, closed at 5:30, ok. 
Drove to the Campbell/Glenn location, again the web says online order not available at the location. Walked into the store and asked  for the $20 family special, the store manager said he can‚Äôt give it to me because the $20 special has to be ordered online, but I said your web says online order us not available at this location, I even showed him my phone, how can I order that. He refused to talk to me any more. I said I‚Äôd file a complaint with the home office, rest is history. The staff was very rude."
Used the app to save time instead of going through the drive thru. Used the app & stated order was ready. Went to pick up & waited for 10 minutes. Called no answer. Called again no answer. Finally went inside to learn they had no record of my order. No problem said they would remake. 30 minutes later still no food. 2 kids on the back seat waiting for food. Finally staff member comes out to check on us because we had been parked for a while. She discovered the restaurant had no record of our order! So she used my confirmation email to make our dinner fresh. We waited for an hour & a half for our food. Still charged us after that. Love Panda bit will skip the app & use drive thru.
"This app is useless; let me tell you why. I ordered lunch for pickup at a specific time. The app knows what dishes the store typically serves, but it doesn‚Äôt know if they will have it available. So I show up to pickup my food right on time, and it‚Äôs not ready because they don‚Äôt have the dish I ordered prepared yet. Every other dish is there sitting in their heating trays except for the one I ordered. So I have to sit there for 20 minutes waiting for it to be finished when in any other circumstance I would have just gotten something else. Not to mention that they prepared the rest of my order and let it sit in the box getting cold while I waited for my other dish. Don‚Äôt waste your time like I did, avoid the app."
"Panda used to be a favorite of mine. Then hit the closures and absurd policies, but I thought, I can order through the app and pick up and avoid having to deal with employees. The payment portion of the app is terrible. It ate the remainder of a gift card once. Every time I try to pay and enter my CC info a big banner is across the screen for Apple Pay. I don‚Äôt use Apple Pay. When I try to fill in the next field it takes me back to the order and looses the CC info so I have to fill it in again. And when I do get an order to go through and pick it up the portion sizes have been dramatically reduced. I rarely eat from Panda anymore. It hasn‚Äôt been a customer friendly experience for a long time now."
"There‚Äôs no way to order sauces. When I order Panda I want sauces on the side, teriyaki, sweet & sour, etc. Now you can enter special instructions and it almost works, but be aware that the printer cuts off more than a couple words, so if you say you want teriyaki and sweet and sour sauce, you get ‚Äúteriyaki and sw‚Äù. This happened last night and being pandemic and getting food to go, we didn‚Äôt see this until we got home and frankly, I‚Äôm not going back to get sauce. The food is not as good without the sauce. 2nd, if you look at appetizers and it pops up veggie rolls, you can‚Äôt get back out. It just keeps popping up veggie rolls. Poor QC here, Dev. Anyway, add a spot to order sauces!"
I ordered online. The site gave them 45 min to prepare my order. So I took my time getting there. Upon arrival I was told it wasn‚Äôt ready and they‚Äôd bring it out. I watched cars pull through the drive through and leave and still no food. After 1 hour from the time my order was placed I went back in to check and was ignored until i asked them where my order was. They acted as if I was from another planet. 1/2 my food was already boxed up the rest they just had not done it yet. I assume they were filling the drive through orders first.  This is NOT ACCEPTABLE!  I am patient and understand things are not normal. But this will not bring me back as a customer and I will give your some free bad advertising.
"The app charges your card instantly but I was told by the store manager that the order is delayed 15 minutes before it gets to the store. I was 10 minutes early and had to wait for my order to be transmitted and then filled.

The site was out of several main course choices and I had to wait for mine to be prepared which totally defeats the purpose of pre-ordering and being charged for having to wait.

This was a complete disappointment. The only saving grace was that the staff were kind.  Lousy online ordering system.  I may consider recourse as I was charged and my order was delayed."
"The people at the drive through were far less than helpful to obvious new customers. I got in line three times because they neglected to inform me that the family meal was only $20 on line. Then they tell me it‚Äôs going to be 20 minutes just to process my order and another half hour to make the same exact meal that my boyfriend ordered at the window... with no Thee customers...

I went to the window 15 minutes early in hopes that my order would be ready. It was so ready that I wonder how long it had been sitting under those hot lights.... I haven‚Äôt even tasted the food yet but I‚Äôm so disgusted by this fast food drive through drama. 

I couldn‚Äôt even check in my order without signing up for their dumb club or whatever. Then I still couldn‚Äôt check my order because I had to download their app too! 

I don‚Äôt care how good this food is, that bunch of bull crap has left me without an appetite and longing for a stiff adult beverage. 

Thanks a lot for the Panda Jamma‚úåüèª"
"Got a new phone and decided to update my apps and payment information. The only way to add a different card or edit existing one that is close to expiring is to order something. Sometimes it takes a while to update payment info so I wanted to do it before placing an order under limited time, like my lunch break. I hope they can fix this. 
Also, app is useless if online ordering is unavailable at your closest Panda or if crew is understaffed or inexperienced; you‚Äôll be there for a while and eventually leave with an incorrect / incomplete order."
"I made a large order for my family because it was a special occasion and we didn‚Äôt want to waste our time together going to the store. I went through the whole process and was told my order went through and to click for tracking information. I just took note of the time it would be arriving and went about my evening. The arrival time passed and I checked, no tracking information but the order is in progress. I waited another half hour because I understand that sometimes delivery takes extra time. Then I was told my order never processed and the store is closing so I can no longer order the food. Had to feed my guest leftovers, hate this app."
"Their app urges users to order delivery so I tried it.  I ended up receiving half of an order via Doordash.  Cool, so I must be able to find a way for the driver to deliver the other half?  No.  Calling the store and letting them know about the situation and they said they are not able to contact the driver, neither is the user of the app.  So the store or Doordash aren‚Äôt able to make things right.  Also, good luck on getting a refund.  It has been 10 days (11/14 order was placed) and after receiving an email on 11/24 from ‚ÄúPanda Guest Care‚Äù, they said I may receive the refund in another 10 days.  Do yourself a favor and just uninstall this app and order elsewhere from another company or restaurant."
"DO NOT SAVE YOUR CARD INFO!!!! Someone from another state got into my Panda account and made a huge order. Turns out others had this problem while using the app few years prior too. Some how these hackers get into your account and make an order, change your phone number, pick up the order and change back the numbers saved onto the account. Emailed Panda customer service and all they said was to take it up with your credit card company (in a nice way at least)

This transaction on my card will look non fraudulent and they will hold me accountable‚Ä¶.. Panda should have taken the responsibility and just refunded the amount when I 1st reached out to them."
"So I placed a delivery order on the 23, never got my order. I waited at least 1 hour since it just started snowing on that day and thought that it would take them a while to delivery my food. 1 hour passes and I still don‚Äôt have my food, I gave them a call twice and they didn‚Äôt answer. After that, I went online to see how to get customer support, and sent them a message, saying that I didn‚Äôt want the food anymore and would like a refund instead. After waiting for one week, I never got a reply back nor did I get a refund. So here I am giving them a bad review. If you ever order, just place an order for pickup so you don‚Äôt end up like me, no food and no refund"
"I attempted to place an order using the app. It doesn‚Äôt support Apple Pay, nor is it able to access your stored credit cards on iOS. You need to manually enter in all your information despite Apple supporting multiple ways of making this easy. Then I attempted place the order. It kept telling to to pick a time for pickup, then it would say that time is not available. When I finally got a pickup time accepted and attempted to process the order, I got another ‚Äúunknown error‚Äù and it dumped my payment information and asked me to re-input it again. I like panda but the app is not usable. I had to order in person, which is not good during a pandemic. Great place, bad app."
"Do not use the app! We did thinking we were scheduling our meal to be ready on time, it was about 4:55 when we placed the order, I was to pick it up at 5:30 and 5:30 on the dot I was there, just to be told my meal was BARELY BEING PREPARED, also I went to pick it up at the door... BIG MISTAKE the staff will prioritize the drive thru and will have you hanging there for as long as your ""meal is ready"".  I went to the door because the drive thru line was very long, well, that line almost disappeared entirely twice before I got my meal... I don't know what the problem was, but if you go to panda go to the DRIVE THRU ALWAYS, they prioritize it over everything else, app and door pick up."
We ordered online and waited 22 minutes. It wasn‚Äôt ready when we got there and had to wait about 5 more minutes. Then when we got our order to the car we ordered Extra extra extra teriyaki sauce and we had NONE. I went to the sort and I understand about not allowing people in the lobby but the manager- yes I said the manager screamed at me from behind the counter and said ‚ÄúGo to the drive thru‚Äù I ordered online to keep from waiting. I do not expect to be treated like I am a three year old doing something wrong. I will NOT visit Panda Express (UN-express) in the future and I will just say ‚ÄúBeware‚Äù and stay away from the Panda Express in Surfside Beach. The manager is very very rude!
"Downloaded the app this evening and set up an account in less than a minute. Was able to place an order for 8 people for pick up in less
then 3 minutes using the app. The easiest food ordering app I have ever used. When I got there at the directed time for pick up, the food was just being brought out. Couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better first experience!"
"What‚Äôs the point of having an app when all the locations near you decide they aren‚Äôt going to take online orders anymore? Every time I‚Äôve tried to order in the last 3-4 months from with the St. Lucie West or Tradition locations (FL), the app says that they aren‚Äôt taking online orders right now. Why? They both did before. I have not ordered from Panda Express in months simply because I can‚Äôt order ahead. The app itself is ok I guess. But the current lack of being able to order from my nearby locations has completely turned me off of both the app, and Panda Express in general."
I placed an order through the app and it told me it would be ready in 35 minutes. I could‚Äôve gotten it sooner had I walked in and thought the purpose of online ordering was to speed up the process so I called the store to see if it would really take 35 minutes and they explained after updating the app they no longer get the order right away and they wouldn‚Äôt get the order for 30 minutes and then they make it in 5. That was a little annoying but the employee was very professional and kind and offered to write my order down and get it ready instead of making me wait 30 minutes for her to just receive it through their system.
"Just went to the Panda Express in Santa Clara.  I ordered 20 mins ahead of time and arrived on time to pick up my order.  I waited 10 mins for someone to acknowledge me and then I had to ask for my order.  The server then made the order and basically through it together and tossed the box a few times putting it in the bag.  There were no utensils and the server was upset at me because they were unable to provide service on time and at least with some ounce of courtesy.  When I got home all of what I had ordered was completely mixed up from the way the server threw it in and then juggled it.

So my question is why have an app that allows you to order ahead of it doesn‚Äôt work and then your employees are upset like it‚Äôs an inconvenience to fill the order? 

This is not the first time as 3 of the last 4 times I have ordered I had to ask for it and it was not ready on time.  I even had to go to great lengths to prove my order once.  

I would think a company of your scale could do with some employee training on the app and customer service."
"Once Panda Express opened in Midland, MI I downloaded this app so I could order take out. Functionality of this app is terrible. Even after setting up an account and entering credit cards, I could hardly get the app to take an order (and I have considerable experience ordering take out on my phone in these pandemic times).

Then Panda Express ‚Äúupdated‚Äù the app and forced me to reconfigure it again (forgot about my previous account). After I did that, the app didn‚Äôt work at all. I was forced to call the restaurant and they had no record of my order. 

Save your time. Get in the drive up line and yell your order out the window. Developers of this app should be fired!"
This app is trash. This app constantly freezes and makes you re type your order a few times then will not let you place it. Then finally after you get the order to the pay screen it won‚Äôt let you sad your payment through because the time isn‚Äôt correct time. When you put asap they select a time for you and still not let you send the order through. I‚Äôve tried to log in through the account i created with the email i regularly use and it won‚Äôt let you. I even trip through Facebook and of course it won‚Äôt let you sign and placing the order through the guest is complete trash. I hate this app. This is one of the worse apps when trying to check out.
"Never use an app like trash like this. No way to log in your account, no way to track your order!

Today I logged in to want to make a deliver order. When I checked out, It turned out want me log in again. And I logged in again as requested, then it turned out need to log in again when check out. That mean, you can never log in your account. I am curious why the app was designed so trash and make it so hard to put an order. So I tried the panda website and find out the website had the same trash system. So if you want to order panda online, deal with the stupid app and have no idea where your food is after you paid money."
"I put the app on my phone, and ordering was easy. HOWEVER, when we got to the store to pick it up, they couldn‚Äôt find it! I had the order number, the order and amount I paid for it- but they had no record of our large order!! We made sure it was the right store and was for pick up‚Äî but the store had nothing!! So they took our phone and had to put it all together!!! What is the point of ‚Äúskipping the lines‚Äù if you still have to wait in line and wait for the order?!? I went back to my app and clicked on ‚Äútrack order‚Äù and it couldn‚Äôt find anything!! Yet- it shows up in my order history?!?! VERY annoying!!"
"I‚Äôve tried ordering online twice now and both times I‚Äôve waited 15+ minutes at the store AFTER the time it was supposed to be ready for my food (the 2nd time prompting this review it took an additional 25 minutes and having to ask twice for an update). 
The app has pictures of every item and makes placing the order easy but sending orders to the store appears to lag heavily. When placing the order, it tells you how long it should take to prepare, expect that to be incorrect! I try to be a patient person but this needs improvement."
"Tried it for the first time today and I‚Äôll probably never use the app again. Every keystroke took an incredibly long time to register, and you‚Äôre left wondering if it didn‚Äôt take. So you press it again and then multiple keystrokes register. I kid you not, between the time I started placing an order for pick up and finishing, it had to tell me twice that my pick up time slot was no longer available and it made me repeat steps multiple times. What a royal pain in the neck to use. I hope it gets updated soon. The corona virus causes people to do a lot of take out vs eating in.  Just driving there and ordering would have been faster. Argh."
"So simple to order! Get to the check out, add a new gift card, click the store gift card, and receive an error that PIN isn‚Äôt required and purchase will NOT process. I went to full site to order, same issue.  Something is wrong with your site/app. Had to pay with my credit card instead. Also, there is no place to add my gift cards to my account so they are available when I make purchases. Please fix this. It should be basic functionality"
"Simply put you can‚Äôt place an order. Says my email is invalid when it isn‚Äôt. Change another email, says ‚Äúsomething went wrong‚Äù during checkout with no way to know what to do to fix the problem. App crashes when you remove items from your basket. I say I want food in 30 minutes app says ‚Äúsomething went wrong, we need more time to make your order‚Äù I call restaurant and they say it will be ready in 10 minutes. 

This is purely bait and switch. App has deals they won‚Äôt honor via phone or at store ‚Äúdeals are online only‚Äù and you cannot place an order online  

Seriously folks who built this app? Fire them."
"Seems most of the time, the cashier has to take orders, confirm the online orders, and make the food for the online orders.  Cashier properly shouldn have to do all that because then it's a delay for us picking up online orders.  I think it would be better if someone was dedicated to doing the Online Orders only to speed up the option.  Last time I ordered,  took an additional 15mins to get my food after the scheduled pick up time.  Ridiculous.  Other then that, everything else is fine.  Wish Panda also did BBQ Pork Buns, but that's not serious."
"Why is steamed rice not an option in the app? It‚Äôs always available at every store location I go to but never an option on the app for any of these same locations. I don‚Äôt care for the fried rice here. Because it‚Äôs not available on the app and I can‚Äôt order ahead (at a place that you typically have to wait an additional 15+ minutes for a side to be cooked), I continue to find myself just going to ChopChop rice instead or elsewhere when I‚Äôm in the mood for this food genre. If y‚Äôall ever decide to fix this feature, I‚Äôll start eating at Panda Express again."
"Blocked entrance allowing one person helped at a time wouldn‚Äôt have been problem except employees allowed one Lady whose order was not ready to wait inside blocking others from getting orders that were ready sitting on tables getting cold.
If her order was not ready ask customer to step outside & wait so they can give out orders to those prepaid &ready for pickup.
I waited 4th person in line 6ft apart outside watching my bag sit on table ready 25 minutes.
Very disappointed even after us in line asked lady to step outside so others can see if our pickups were ready. Employees allowed Lady to ignore courtesy for others blocking pickups."
"App seems like the bare-minimum, thrown together. Missing a lot of basic functionality and doesn‚Äôt seem like there‚Äôs a real system established on the in-house end.
Ex: I‚Äôd ordered through the app but it would have been faster just going through either the line or drive-thru.

It took maybe 10 min for me to drive down after placing my order, not quite 5 min standing in line to tell them I was there for a mobile order, told it would be about 3 minutes but then waited for at least 10 while 4 sets of in-person orders & the drive thru were kept moving.

So, using their app offers no advantages in time, there are no offers/deals/coupons/rewards so you‚Äôre not saving any money, doesn‚Äôt allow you to see/order from their full menu, and doesn‚Äôt seem to make anything any easier for the staff. 

I can‚Äôt think of a single reason you‚Äôd want to use this app.   ...other than you lost your CreditCard and wanna pay using the app..."
"I use restaurant apps frequently as I am a working and busy mom. Not only was my order not ready at the allotted time for pick up, it wasn‚Äôt even in their system. I came through the drive thru to get my order and was treated like I had the plague. I was told I was holding up ‚Äúher line‚Äù because my order wasn‚Äôt in the system yet. So I went around and drove around again only to be told my order still was not showing up. Then they were directed by the manager to give me some canned answer about not distributing mobile orders through the drive thru. Why when every other restaurant can somehow figure it out? It was a waste and an annoyance to use the app."
"I love me some Panda Express and eat there a ton. This app is nice and convenient because it seems I either get a lot of complicated people in front of me or I have to wait forever for food to cook. With this app, it‚Äôs always ensured to be ready whenever I get there with no hassle. 

But have you guys ever thought of starting a rewards program? As much as I eat there, it would be nice to get free things here and there to know my loyalty is appreciated. Just a thought. That would make this a five-star app"
"I ordered the plate with Beijing beef. After coming back to work I open my food to find out I only have noodles! The app says I only ordered noodles, so I thought I messed up though I do remember vividly ordering the beef. So I go through the same process making my selection as I did before. Again I choose beef. Then when I looked at my order, it says I only ordered noodles. I look at my receipt that I got in store and it too also says I only ordered noodles. Why is the app asking me what entree I want if it‚Äôs only going to give me the side? Not only was my order missing items, but the item it did have was cold! Cause this inconvenience I was not able to eat, or get my money back."
"The app works good, it just needs an option to submit a survey or review your order. My local Panda Express is always out of something on my order, so they don‚Äôt make it until I get there. This most recent order they were out of Coke. I wanted to get reimbursed for the drink on my order and they said they‚Äôd have to get a manager and were running around clueless. Then I decided to just take the cup and fill it with Cherry Coke. Terrible idea. Their cherry coke was not mixed right or almost out too. Please let us submit our reviews through the app!!"
"Ordered online. Picked up in drive through. Are the egg roll and shrimp and was full! Egg was basic. The shrimp were large, coated in a tasty coating. The greens are kale and broccoli and not overcooked. My favorite was the noodles which were al dente and mixed with a sweet sauce and veggies. Another new favorite is the chicken with green beans. Beans are fresh and not overcooked. Mixed with a tasty sauce in bits of chicken. Couldn‚Äôt eat it all. Service was fast, even in drive through! I‚Äôll definitely go back!"
"Have tried using this app multiple times and have issues the past few times making it impossible to place an online order.  Twice now it takes me all the way through and then rejects my payment information and then cannot connect to the app.  Today it also did not offer all entrees available at the Polaris location.  I called them to confirm they offered the entree and had it available and they did.

App is easy to navigate but not much good if I can‚Äôt use it to order food (it‚Äôs primary purpose!)."
This app has let me down numerous times. Order hasn‚Äôt been ready when it‚Äôs said it‚Äôs supposed to be more than once while I watch walk-up orders get served before I do even though I ordered 20 minutes earlier than them. Won‚Äôt let you choose stuff like no ice in the soda or even add a comment or customization request anywhere. And today it decided that the ‚Äúplace order‚Äù button would just trigger it to come up with a new delivery time without actually placing an order. Made me drive across town and waste diesel and time. Panda Express will be losing most of my business because of this app‚Äôs shortfalls.
"Trying times i know. First world problems, I get it.  But when you get tired of cooking 3 meals a day for 5 people and cleanup you like a break.  Other food apps not a problem. This panda so doesn‚Äôt work well.  Cannot go to restaurant to order in person, you can only order through the ap.  

I cannot enter credit card info for payment and it‚Äôs only way to move forward with order. Cannot pay on site and cannot send in order because it doesn‚Äôt like my card number.  Tried several times and had second person try it on different device.   

What a mess, Panda.   Fix the ap."
"Often times the app is glitchy. Today it didn‚Äôt offer any option to order white rice. So I ended up ordering a side of just Orange Chicken instead of the plate of Orange chicken with rice. When I arrived they said they have plenty of white rice and everything looked fine on their end. But I didn‚Äôt sense any urgency on their part to correct the issue or notify someone that their app isn‚Äôt working. So it comes down to this, if I didn‚Äôt happen to have some leftover white rice at home, I would have passed on Panda and gone to other restaurants with better apps."
"This morning the app was not properly charging cards, so I called the restaurant.  They confirmed this and said to come in and they would give me the $20 deal in the drive thru.  When I arrived they told me this wasn‚Äôt possible.  I finally got the app to work and pulled in to be told they needed 10-15 minutes to get the ticket and make the food. I wait, pull back around and they then proceed to tell me that it hasn‚Äôt come in yet and they cannot do anything until it does.  Your company and app are garbage.  There is no option to check in and get food made in a timely manner.  I am done with this."
"So, I normally do not write reviews, but I have
been a fan of Panda Express for years. I know it is a challenging time, but the last 2 times I have ordered via your site it has been a lousy experience with the last order being not even available ( Fremont, CA ...Walnut & Fremont Blvd)and them telling me the restaurant was closed at 6:43pm! So my cc was charged and I had no food! The kid at the door said. I don‚Äôt know what to tell ya...but we‚Äôre closed....and shuts the door. My last order in CV was missing the three appetizers and no fortune cookies....what the heck?....The restaurants don‚Äôt answer their phone....I‚Äôm not going to drive back."
"I placed an app order and drove 30 miles to pick up what was supposed to be a large teriyaki chicken and a large order of noodles.  When I picked up the orders in the drive through the orders were placed in bowels instead of the boxes. I was told they were out of boxes. 

When I got home it was obvious the bowl of noodles was not full and it didn‚Äôt go nearly as far as normal. I am very displeased as I was still charged full price for the boxes and then shorted on food after driving all that way.  

I realize things are difficult right now but there is no excuse for not providing the product you charged for."
"I can‚Äôt use it, or even their web site, because it‚Äôs still lacking essential elements. While you can have spring rolls as one of your items, every store tells me, the app doesn‚Äôt give that option. And since they changed the kids meal to fruit slices instead of a cookie, you can‚Äôt say you want the cookie instead. We eat Panda as a treat, so anything goes. We aren‚Äôt looking for healthy on those infrequent visits, so this is a non-starter. I want to select the meal, I want to select the side, I want to select the drink, and I want to select the dessert‚Äîcookie."
"Made and online order and went to side door to pick up.  Customers in front had online order and were asked if they did.  When it was my turn I was skipped over twice for customers that order at the door, and even after the 2nd person, I asked Yanira why I was skipped twice and not helped.  She replied very very rudely that I needed to let her know why I was there.  Also, the order was completely wrong, not worth getting fixed after this.  If you want to be treated like crap, especially during these times, for a basic meal that is incorrect...go to this Panda Express!!!!"
"I always went in person to order my food since I never noticed the online order. Today I finally tried it and it was bad. What‚Äôs the point of adding the stuff into the food if it‚Äôs out of order when I get it. For example, I got white steam rice with orange chicken and grilled chicken with a side of grill chicken (bigger plate) special instruction (3 sides of teriyaki sauces). The side was orange chicken and I didn‚Äôt care but I hated was that I didn‚Äôt get my sauces. So I‚Äôm uninstalling the app just because I rather go in person and get my order right."
"Every single time I try to use this app to order my food it fails! Every. Single. Time. It let‚Äôs me get all the way to the end and then will not let me place the order. It says there‚Äôs a missing *Required field but every single time I try to click on that field it will not pull anything up. Not only does it not pull anything up to allow me to type whatever it is that‚Äôs missing, it doesn‚Äôt even tell me what is supposed to be in that *Required field, it‚Äôs just a blank *Required field! I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app and it STILL. NEVER. WORKS. This app is absolutely useless!"
"The only positive things I can say about this app is that it will help you locate restaurants and will provide the menu for those not familiar with what is available.  I do not recommend using this app to place an order.  Panda Express has a horrific system in place for online/app ordering.  When you submit an order, it seemingly goes to a central location to be processed before it is pushed out to the store.  It can take in excess of 30 minutes between your submission and the store receiving your order.  You are better off ordering in person at the restaurant."
"Placed my order 45 minutes before pickup, and showed up a little later than that. I still had to wait another 25 minutes to actually get my food. They ran out of something I had ordered but the last of it ( baby scoop sized that it was) found its way into my plate. They gave me a free fountain drink and upgraded my side so I‚Äôm happy and will love on. Their food will forever taste good so I will continue my ventures there."
"This app scheduled my order to be ready at 6:18pm onJuly 4, and my order was ready at 8pm on July 5,26 hours later!  While 26 hours may seem a bit long to wait for a ‚Äúfast food‚Äù order this was actually because this nearly useless app completed the order, and yes, charged me, without being able to tell me that the store had decided to take the holiday off, so when I drove the 20 miles to this location I was greeted by a closed store.  Management filled the order the next day with no apology or extra items, so rest assured, they are looking out for you the customer!"
"Overall, it is a decent app, with a few glaring issues. 

1. No Apple Pay support, so I have to leave a CC on file to be able to use the app, which leads into #2. 
2. If I change my account password on the website, it doesn‚Äôt automatically log the account out, which it should kill all active logins as a security precaution (since most people change their password due to account comprimisation)."
"This is is pretty garbage at the moment. The favorite of a menu item feature doesn‚Äôt work, the app itself hangs and freezes constantly, during the hangs if you tap something too many times it will go crazy, multiple times I have had issues ordering where it won‚Äôt let me put an order in due to the time/date selection being wonky and having all times grayed out so I end up just calling my order in. Hopefully this is fixed soon as I tend to go here a lot and it is frustrating every single time I open this app."
"The app works fine for me up to the pick up time. It says the pick up time will be displayed in the cart area, which it does. The pick up time remains the same up to the time you pay for the order. Suddenly anywhere from 10 - 20 minutes is tagged on to the pick up time. While I understand orders may be added to the line as I am paying, it seems odd when every time the pick up estimate changes AFTER I pay for the food."
"First, app lets you set 7 character password, web forces 8. Then when you pick HALF Fried Rice the order shows ‚ÄúWHITE Fried Rice‚Äù. Guess what you get when you pick up your order? WHITE STEAMED rice. Dumb. Then the app would not process my card. Triple checked details. Everything correct. Tried to process again, app said ‚Äúhaving problems connecting‚Äù, closed and re-opened app and of course, order gone. Went online and ordered via web. No probs with card but still had the dumb rice thing. Plus after placing order, screen never changed. But email came with order placed. Kind of screwy and took way too long. Could have stood in line in less time."
"So I thought I might download the app to order ahead for dinner, but was surprised when there‚Äôs no option for their tea? Their drink options are only soda products and bottled drinks. So there‚Äôs no point in ordering ahead if I‚Äôm still going to have to order my drink in-store.

Also the app doesn‚Äôt seem very functional? Like it took me a minute to figure out how to add something to my cart because it appears that you can only check out once you select your entree. Also wasn‚Äôt convenient to add a drink on to the order. It‚Äôs 2020, no reason for apps like these."
This Panda Express was excellent. My order was done on time and I received exactly what I ordered and received my sauce and all my item I requested. Just a few days ago I ordered from another Panda Express #0643 and it was terrible no sauce and my drink came in a bottle that I could not open because I had no bottle opener and no cookie and I was not happy with service.
"The conveniency of using the app is great, that is until someone was able to order from my account from a different state. Not sure how they did it but they were able to order from my account under my name with my credit information. So developers please implement a 2-step payment verification before an order can be completed. I've have sent a email but have yet to receive a response from P.E Customer Service. I won't be using this app anymore until there are extra precaution added."
"I live in San Diego literally two exits away from the Mexico Border. I placed an order and went through it the way it was set up. Made sure to select the Panda Express that is literally the next exit up from my house. For some reason after hitting confirm order, my order literally jumps all the way to another location almost 25 minutes away from me. To even get my money back and canceling the order was a pain. It takes 2 to 3 business days to get your money back through the people that control the app. Don‚Äôt use it. Your food order might end up in another state."
"I use a lot of fast food apps bc I‚Äôm a fatass american and this is up there as one of the better ones. There is still room for improvement though. 

I wish there was a way to validate free entree redemption codes from surveys through the app. In the past I‚Äôve had to go inside or use the drive thru to do that which I don‚Äôt want to do because I wanna grab my food and go."
Smooth and organized app. The online order system is a little unorganized. There needs to be a spot in the store where they leave online items. If you order pickup in the app you have to wait in line anyway bc they haven‚Äôt filled the order. Or let you opt to pickup in drive thru. The store I go to accepts Apple Pay on the inside but I don‚Äôt always have time to go inside or want to with the pandemic. Please accept Apple Pay in the app.
"The last two times I‚Äôve ordered from the app the quoted time for pickup changes dramatically before and after you pay. Tonight I ordered at 7:45 when the app said the pickup time would be 8. Once the payment processed it said ‚Äúorder ready for pickup at 9.‚Äù Feels a bit like a bait and switch as I wouldn‚Äôt have ordered if I thought it would take over an hour. Besides this, the app functions as it should."
"Took me about 10 minutes to submit an order because this app is slow.  You push a button to make a selection and it freezes for about 10-15 seconds before it starts working again.  When enter addresses it let you enter 4-5 letters/numbers and it freezes for 10-15 seconds then it allows you to enter another 4-5 digits then it freezes again.  This keeps going until you‚Äôre done entering all your info.  

Not a good app. Panda needs to change developer."
"Can‚Äôt ever use this app. It ALWAYS gives me some kind of problem. Now I try to open it and says I need to update to another version yet when I try, it doesn‚Äôt do anything. I deleted the app and reinstalled and still does the same thing. On past ‚Äúusages‚Äù it won‚Äôt take my order b/c of some stupid problem they have with the time. Sure is a shame you can‚Äôt make a better app than this. I‚Äôve just given up altogether. Another less place to be able to get anything from and living in a smallish town there aren‚Äôt many choices anyway. Really irritating."
I‚Äôve used the app twice and both times I arrive at the time my confirmation app tells me and they do not have my food ready. Tonight I placed an order at 6:27 and was told in Panda‚Äôs confirmation email to pick up at 6:45. I arrived at 6:50 (long line at the drive thru) and they had no idea. I had to hand my phone to the drive thru kid to go over my confirmation email only to be told I had placed the order 5 minutes ago and I should go around and drive through in 5 minutes. When I did I was asked all the same questions again and they just made my order. Ridiculous.
"Portions are definitely smaller when you order on the app. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because you aren‚Äôt standing right in front of them when they scoop, but the container was at least 1/3 less when ordering thru app and just picking it up. Also, double check you have the right pre-paid take-out order. More than once I have been given someone else‚Äôs order even when I verified the name."
"Stores aren‚Äôt able to even start your order until the time shown when u order. Usually 10-15 min. With any other restaurant app I use, I can literally place the order on their app as I‚Äôm pulling up to the drive through and they have the order and prepare it right then. I just pulled in to a PE 3 minutes after placing my order and was told I had to park until they got the order receipt into their system. They couldn‚Äôt even start my order until they received it from their internal system. I won‚Äôt be using this app again until they fix this deficiency."
"What a useless app! You would think the point of making a mobile order is to avoid lines and not waiting for your food but not with this app! 

I always pick up my food 5 minutes after the time the app tells me my order will be ready to give them time but that‚Äôs not enough! Most days I wait 20-45 mins. I see the line they have and is gone. Another one forms and is gone, everybody gets helped before the mobile orders! 

Why have mobile orders if the people who get in line get their food faster?? Completely useless! My honest advice, avoid this app or get in line. It‚Äôs a lot faster!!"
We put in our order on line and when we arrived they were out of chow main really and then had to wait for they order behind everyone else only to find out they had to cook string beans and we had to wait again   It is now 30 minutes after they said it would be ready and we are still waiting. Last time at the panda. No wonder the place is empty
Tried to place an order for next available but that was actually too quick Sinai tried to add five minutes and it kept making me change the time but wouldn‚Äôt accept any time I put in - just gave an error to reselect the time. Finally killed the app and started over and again chose next available and it said the time I had wanted so I placed the order then it gave me a confirmation for 25 minutes later than it said at checkout. Not fun.
"West County Panda- cold food. Except on weekends during peak hours. I work at the mall so my food is mostly cold ALL the time. Also placed order for honey sesame chicken and they told me the promotion was out when two other locations I've called and spoken to managers have said they still have it for about 2-3 more weeks then it will be out. So instead of making some freshly new they told me a lie. Also I placed order on app and WAITED 10MIN! On my 15MIN BREAK!!! This is upsetting & poor customer service. That day I had no food for my ""lunch"" -I didn't work the required hours to get a 30min break. So I only got a 15 that day. And thanks to Panda At West County no Food."
"It is so strange to me that many apps don‚Äôt use Apple Pay. My frustration is that I have to put my credit card information into each individual app, plus you would think the apps wouldn‚Äôt want to have to deal with that security information and just let that be dealt with in Apple Pay. Overall the app is nice, but I wish there was a rewards program built in and that you could see past purchases (which may be an option I haven‚Äôt checked)."
"When you order online or on an app and you walk in and everyone in line is served and then people that walk in after you are served and gone before someone asks if you have been helped, makes this concept completely pointless. If I‚Äôm standing in the line for online pick up and you ignore me or wonder what I‚Äôm doing then this process needs to be re-evaluated. I thought the first time I tried the app order and this happened, it was just a one time mistake. But then it happed again. They didn‚Äôt even start making my food or look at the order until I said something."
It‚Äôs a great way to see what options to buy. But don‚Äôt order from the app just go to the store. You order the app and they give you a 20-30 min time when it is done. I get there early and they cannot find my order. I show them the order on the phone and they said I had to wait 5 min before the promise time to pick up. There is no one in the store or the drive through. Just me. I park in a stall and there are 5 people inside just standing around. Next time I‚Äôll just come to the store and won‚Äôt bother with the app.
"Panda Express restaurants are pretty famous for not being ready for lunch (e.g. you show up at 1130 and half the food isn‚Äôt ready), for being under staffed and other basic failures. So it was no surprise for me that the app is also not customer friendly.  Can‚Äôt use Apple Pay so you have to enter your card payment info AGAIN.  You have to enter your address to use a credit card (even though you do not in person).  And many other little things that make ordering unnecessarily inefficient.  It‚Äôs disappointing but not surprising."
Panda‚Äôs food is always delicious and I‚Äôve only had one bad experience with online ordering: the order timing was not accurate in that circumstance. I arrived to the restaurant on time (the time specified that the order would be ready) to pick up my order but it had not even been started as the chow mein was not ready. Employees were taking from the new chow mein when it did arrive and the order was still not filled. Quite a long time after I was kept waiting to pick up.
"I installed the app because there was a T-Mobile promotion and I wanted to get some food. Once I opened the app, it wouldn't let me ""continue as a guest"" nor ""sign up"". Fam I just want some food.

UPDATE: Turns out the reason the app wouldn't work was because a lot of people were signing up at the same time as I was. App works great and looks fantastic. I was too quick to judge. My b"
"On 3 occasions I‚Äôve used the app to place my order at the Normal, il restaurant. Not once has it been ready upon arrival. Today...I placed the order at 10:50 asking that it be ready by 11:15. I arrived at 11:30 to find a partial amount of my order sitting off to the side. I was told it would be a little longer as they were waiting for more Beijing Beef. I‚Äôd understand more if the restaurant was packed and the line out the door. However, you open at 10:30, order placed at 10:50, no line and only a handful of customers. Very poor service for something that is supposed to be a time saver. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
This would be such an amazing app if I could just order drinks. I go to Panda at least once a week and a huge reason for that is your China Mist Iced Tea. This app is so convenient when ordering my food items but for some reason I can‚Äôt order drinks on it? I go to the drinks and all I get is a blank white screen with that little tool bar asking if I have any food allergies? I don‚Äôt know if this is because I have an iPhone but as soon as that is fixed I will be very pleased with the app.
"I was trying to place an order and it would not go thru I called the store she was like it because we have to many orders try later  really later I‚Äôm here now  
After 1/2 hr I finally got it to work after I had to delete the order and start over  it was because they must have been out of the one item why didn‚Äôt it just tell me that 
They should get fixed  very aggravating 
Thank you
Susan"
"Always great at this location! Great staff really pleasant and always friendly. I‚Äôd have given 5+ stars but the portion sizes are shrinking. Other than that, I‚Äôve been to the rest and this ones the best! Hands down in cos this is the best Panda Express in the inland empire! Do yourself a favor a eat here! You won‚Äôt regret it and if you don‚Äôt like it I‚Äôll donate to the charity they ask about here! 
Cheers"
This location is great. Recently I was in the area and I had online ordered a pickup at this store and the estimated wait time was unexpected. Due to this occurrence I went in the store and asked the manger and the register worker if we could resolve this issue. They pleasantly greeted my request and completed it with perfection and a smile. I hope to see these workers and this store again.
The app is fine the service just cannot deliver a equal to or better than experience than showing up randomly to order whatever might be available. Ordering by the app takes longer than going in and getting the order assuming what you want is available. It seems to be a constant problem that they don‚Äôt have enough food no matter what time of day it is and people waiting and waiting. I‚Äôm not waiting anymore.
The app asked if I wanted the soonest available pickup time of 7:05 p.m. I said yes then placed an order for one plate. I entered in my credit card info and finished. It said my order would be ready at 7:30 p.m. I didn‚Äôt want to wait so I go to Panda Express and ask for my order. They don‚Äôt have my order because they don‚Äôt print it out until close to pickup time. I can‚Äôt cancel my order because there is no manager on duty. They refuse to make the order until it prints out. My only option is to wait outside in record heat. Unbelievable!
"At the end of check out after putting all your card info you have to click the payment button again to get a new pick up time. Because then it will say something went wrong, the app should just give you a new time after you make a payment, I thought I put in the wrong card information..."
"It‚Äôs takes a while for the actual app to load, after it too 10 minutes to put in what I wanted, then I wanted to add more and the menu didn‚Äôt load. Then I had to put contact info and kept saying that it couldn‚Äôt prices it or something and I had to keep trying to put in the same info. And at check out it came up a couple of times that payment couldn‚Äôt be processed, and until now after putting in my order I can‚Äôt even track it because the tracker takes forever to load."
"I had placed an order for 5 bowls. When I got there at the time it said it would be ready, they hadn‚Äôt started the order yet. The lady said they lost the receipt and didn‚Äôt know what was ordered yet she was able to simply print it out. Then a man hands me the orders and said everything is there correctly. I get home and that isn‚Äôt the case. 1 was supposed to be 1/2 white and 1/2 brown rice and the other one was supposed to be white rice. Both came with fried rice and they don‚Äôt like fried rice. I also asked that this time they don‚Äôt forget the fortune cookies and chop sticks, guess what..they did."
It‚Äôs pointless to order from this app unless you have them take it directly from your credit card. It wont allow you to use gift cards from it unless they are $20 plus. You can‚Äôt order anything under $10 for delivery and it won‚Äôt add gift cards together either. I have $8.80 on one and $10 on another and can‚Äôt use either. Cashiers can‚Äôt use the app either with your gift cards on them because it won‚Äôt display the full number. Guess we won‚Äôt be eating at Panda Express any time soon.
The app does not work. When you start to plan your menu it will not continue past the first step. Even the website is no good as soon as you can get your food as far less time than driving across town and standing in line that‚Äôs negating any benefit of ordering online or through the app. I must agree with other critics that their pricing model is unfair. They make the website and app difficult to use and walk and you pay more the app and website you have to wait. This is ridiculous
"Love to order Panda Express and then pick it up. I used to have no problems doing this with this app, but the latest update has messed up. No more family packs on the order screen, so I try to order a la carte. No matter which menu item I click on, it won‚Äôt get ordered without a size, but there is no where that I can select a size! Why did you update an app that worked just fine to one that doesn‚Äôt work?"
"To start, the food was cold and it didn‚Äôt take long to get here. I paid $1.25 ‚ÄúEXTRA‚Äù for shrimp in a plate only to get a tiny box containing some veggies, eight dried red peppers, and four shrimp. That‚Äôs NOT EXTRA, that‚Äôs a quarter per shrimp, then some.  It wasn‚Äôt even a whole part of the dish, plus, it had fallen over in the bag and gotten grease all over everything else in there.  I‚Äôm so disappointed in that. I‚Äôm used to spicy, but that‚Äôs too much. Frankly, I really miss the Eggplant Tofu, that is a delicious dish."
"My order got cancelled TWICE! A driver called me and refused to even speak on the phone. I said, ‚ÄúHello‚Äù multiple times and never got a response, just call drops and I was called by this stranger twice! 
I called the store for a refund and stated the app is not giving me the option for one and they said they couldn‚Äôt help me. I‚Äôm still waiting to be contacted by the app and nothing! This has been a constant thing with Panda Express now. Might as well not even do delivery if there‚Äôs ALWAYS going to be a problem! It‚Äôs extremely ASININE!"
"As I was ordering, it said my order would be ready by 6:20 which I was okay with. Upon submitting my payment and having the order go through, it said my order would now be ready at 6:45. If I knew it was going to take 45 minutes to have my order ready I would have gone elsewhere. I don‚Äôt ever have an issue with the food, but a 25 minute difference is a bit misleading when I‚Äôm hangry and trying to get something quick. Disappointed."
"App works fine, I just wish there were more deals or points if you order by app. I just don‚Äôt see the benefit of using the app if I can just order there. Also for some reason if I have to call the store after placing an order on the app the store will not answer the phone. I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs more so the stores problem or if it has to do with the app but it‚Äôs kind of a bummer."
"I used this app because I had a free chicken bowl offer from t-mobile.  To use the offer, you have to place an order for future pickup.  I have a long commute home and never know how long it will take to complete it, so I couldn‚Äôt place the order until I got very close to the Panda Express. Now the app tells me it will be 30 minutes to get my order!  Considering that I could walk in now and have my food in less than 5 minutes, this is absurd.  I will never use this app again and would not recommend this service for anybody."
"This app is useless, plain and simple. When you select your meal (1 side 2 entrees etc.) the only option that shows is add to order. However, when you click that, it comes up with an error messages stating you need to choose a option for 1 and 2 in step 1. There is no step 1 available. If you choose a kids meal the only option you can choose is a drink in step 3, no step 1 or 2 ever appears. What purpose does this mobile app really serve if you can‚Äôt even use it? Very disappointing."
My whole family and I go to Panda Express all the time and we are in this crisis right now and they are doing an amazing deal with lots of food to last multiple days or feed a huge family and it‚Äôs a great place to eat and the lady‚Äôs and gentlemen that serve us are always amazing thank you
"Placed app order for Family feast, time automatically gave me 15 min window, as soon as I paid, the time switched to a 45 min window! I drove to the store(only took 10 mins) Store didn‚Äôt even have the order yet.  Manager said she couldn‚Äôt make my order until the order came they their system even though she looked at my app to see my paid order on my app.  The order came thru 10 mins after i got there and they made it...Get this app together!  What‚Äôs the point in using it if i can order faster in the store?"
I first tried to use this app about 3 weeks ago. It wasn‚Äôt loading properly and never processed my payment/order. It was very frustrating and took 20 minutes with no results. Today I tried again and I‚Äôm pretty disappointed that the only methods of pay are credit or gift card. Other restaurant apps have Apple Pay which is my preferred method of payment.
"WORTHLESS APP AND COMP WASTE OF TIME. 
I ordered by using the app with ample time, 20+ minutes. Got to the establishment exactly at the time the app advised me the order was going to be ready. I arrive at the window and the employee tells me ‚Äúwe will start working on your order, park in the front and the order will be taken to you when ready‚Äù. 
Waste of time to order w the app if I still had to wait 10+ extra minutes in the parking lot for my order. I thought the point of ordering on the app was supposed to ease the waiting time and have the food ready when the customer arrives."
"I‚Äôve used this app many times and it‚Äôs always worked without any glitches. The only problem I‚Äôve had has been the last 2 times I tried to use it Super Greens has been removed as an option for a side. Boo! So then I have to call in the order which is clumsy,  and then they try to tell me that it‚Äôs easier for me if I use the app. I agree it would be easier, but I can‚Äôt order my super greens. Please bring back this option!!!"
"We used to go to the Panda Express in Buckeye Az twice a week.. Then my wife‚Äôs orange chicken started getting real spicy like the Kung Pau chicken.. We finally went back tonight for dinner.,,My wife got the orange chicken and beef and broccoli.. The orange chicken was good but the beef and broccoli had about 3 pieces of beef.. I got the spicy chicken breast and spicy angus beef.. The chicken was a little skimpy and the angus beef was non existent.. VERY DISAPPOINTED.. Just beware of that when you go thru the drive thru.. I don‚Äôt know about the rest of the locations, But this has happened more the once at this location"
"Great app, easy and efficient BUT Missing a few menu items like rangoons and no place for a remark to add it or tell them not to give me wrong thing like last time when I added them at the door and got more egg rolls. Fortunately they were fresh and good. But quick and efficient overall. Appreciate the effort. Note: Kung pao suddenly so spicy it‚Äôs inedible- burns your tongue."
"No one seems to be able to quickly find my mobile order and I‚Äôm constantly getting promo emails. There is no option to update my account info on the app or the web from my phone. The only option is to cancel the account and only thru contacting customer service? Why can‚Äôt I update my own profile?! 

Are account options deactivated because I sign in with my Apple ID?"
"The app is well designed and responsive, and I really like that you can place an order with a specific pickup time (as opposed to ‚Äútap this button when you get here‚Äù on other apps). The ONLY thing that bothers me is that I had to put in my card info manually, an Apple Pay option would get this app to 5 stars!"
There is always a problem when trying to place an order on this app. It does not let you select a pick up time without giving you an error message that tells you to select a different pick up time. The app also has an issue with delaying an order when you are running late. Why have an option to delay your order by 10 - 30 mins if it is only going to give you another error message telling you select a different pick up time.
"Placed my order online and the app said it‚Äôd be a twenty minute wait and when we pulled up to panda about 10 minutes later I checked the app, it added 30 minutes to our wait time. Wouldn‚Äôt have ordered if I knew the actual time I would have to wait. I‚Äôm Standing out here still waiting while people are coming and ordering and leaving with their food. Definitely won‚Äôt use the app next time seeing as people that are showing up 20 minutes later than me are being served first."
"I don‚Äôt see how this app has so many good reviews.  The UI is sluggish to the point of being unusable.  The window would often not scroll, then it would try to catch up, and put you in a strange place, such as confirming your order, before you have ordered anything!   I have experience with other casual fast food apps that work much better.  You should take a pass on this one.  You do not get any loyalty points, so no reason to use the App."
"The restaurant isn‚Äôt open except for one person to order in the breezeway at a time. If you order through the app, you don‚Äôt know when your order is ready. They keep adding items to the ‚Äòpick up‚Äô shelf and you have to go inside to check if it is yours each time they add something. There are at least 10 cars waiting for food. Someone just came and ordered in the front lobby and got their food in 1 minute and we have been waiting 20 min."
"Every 4-5 seconds the app freezes for 5 seconds. Maybe it caught the last few characters or selection you made, maybe not. Really annoying when otherwise everything else is great. You will miss the first available checkout window. If adding a payment method, give yourself 10 minutes to order anything. 5 stars if this is fixed."
"WARNING!  THIS APP STEALS MONEY AND PANDA EXPRESS WILL DISAVOW PAYMENTS MADE THROUGH THE APP.

According to Panda Express management, this app is NOT developed by Panda Express, but rather a third party.  It will take any gift card information and drain the card before shutting down and not processing your order.  Management claims that it is helpless to do anything, and that this is a chronic problem with the app.  Nothing is being done to fix it.  SO BEWARE -- DO NOT USE GIFT CARDS WITH THIS APPLICATION!  The money will be taken from the gift card and you will not get your food."
"My 2 star review is because about 50% of the time that I try to order through this app I get an error message that tells me the app is down and to please try again later. Then if you call to try to place the order via phone, I am told that they only take online orders or in person orders. When that has happened, I have just spent my money elsewhere at restaurants that will take a phone order and deliver."
When I placed my order after attending church this evening; I loved the ability of going directly to the online order pickup and getting my prepaid dinner.  When I walked into the Panda restaurant there was a line approximately thirty feet long waiting to place their order to the clerk. I was in and out with my dinner in two minutes. BEAUTIFUL!
"This app is the worst! It never seems to work. The website ordering does not work either! 
Such a huge company and they can‚Äôt fix their on line ordering. We eat at Panda Express a lot and being able to pre order is so helpful. Unfortunately it did not work right pre covid but you would have thought they would have fixed it during covid. 
 Let‚Äôs hope they make it a priority soon. This in no way reflects the employees, I‚Äôve always had good service."
"I ordered from the app for a restaurant pickup but somehow my order was sent to door dash as a delivery. I went to the restaurant to pick up and while I was waiting, the delivery driver picked up my food and drove it to my apartment. The restaurant was almost hesitant to remake my food, so while on the phone with the driver, he had to turn around and bring it back. The driver didn‚Äôt even have my full address, just my billing address. Very worried about this glitch and now I won‚Äôt ever be using it again."
I placed my order on the app as I have in the past. The order was not ready when I got there 8 minutes later. There was nobody in line. The employee looked at my phone and told me it wouldn‚Äôt be ready until the time given. That was 5 minutes longer than when I placed the order. And she was unable to even pull up the order. Nobody offered to make the order now even though there were no customers. I was just told to come back later. I did only because you already charged my card.
I only had to wait 15minutes for my family entree that I placed online that was good customer service to me and my family. We will definitely use the app to order our food again we like it a lot. Panda Express please keep up the great customer service!!
"I placed an order online thinking it would be quicker just like the app described since I live a good twenty to thirty minutes away from the nearest location. However, when I arrived they made me wait for another thirty minutes since the app decides your time of pick up. Place was not even busy and yet they made me and my family wait. Pretty sure it would have been quicker to stand in line and order there. Not using the app again unless I have an hour or more to wait doing nothing at a table while they attend other people first."
"The app is better than many but it still has little quirks that make it frustrating to use quickly. Especially with login and and payment- if they allowed Apple Pay I think they‚Äôd have more traction on this. Also missing login with Apple. Anyway, you‚Äôll eventually get your order in, and it works, but it‚Äôs not enjoyable getting there."
"The app works well and looks good, however some options are missing in the app even though they are present on the website. For example, white steamed rice was missing from all of the side options."
"I previously deleted this app because it was so wonky and useless but I reinstalled it today thinking that the new version would be better. Well it‚Äôs not it all took me over half an hour for a simple order, and then when my friend went to pick it up they didn‚Äôt have the order apparently you didn‚Äôt send me a confirmation they asked for the order number and the confirmation and it was pretty hellish trying to find this information especially never when I got the confirmation email. Very annoying."
"The app is okay it is the franchisees that are trash for hiring incompetent works. Placed an order, order portion was completely incorrect. I sent an email to PE headquarters, received a vague response about informing the franchisees about the issues. Franchisees may speak with the employee. How does that help me, I need my check adjusted. This is not the time to be giving money away. Adjust my check amount. Sidebar; it hurts my heart to no longer use PE, the food is so good but the attention to detail is a big disappointment.

Update: I received a email response from corporate. 
‚Äú Thank you for reaching out to us. We have not nor will we be processing a refund of any sort for this order at this time. If you would like to be reimbursed please contact your bank for further assistance. 

Thank you,

Guest Care.‚Äù"
"Ordered online and received confirmation on pickup and when I reached Panda Express then they said wait in the car and we‚Äôll bring to car. Waited for ~25 mins outside in car and no updates. When I went in they said we could not find your order in system. When I asked why didn‚Äôt you inform me I was waiting outside for 25 mins then have no answer. No apologies or sorry, terrible. Finally called their customer care to get a refund. Never again!"
"I‚Äôve tried with this app. Both times I ended up having to wait over a half hour after the food was promised, because they lost the order among other online orders. I‚Äôve been told I ordered from the wrong location, I‚Äôve been told I never placed the order (despite having a screenshot of the order number and location). Eventually I get a, ‚ÄúSorry about that‚Äù and told that app orders are ‚Äúsometimes lost‚Äù. I will not use the app again."
"I used the Panda Express app with no issues within the last few months. However today presumably after an updated version was installed, I was not able to make an online order at all. After entering the credit card info and pressed the option to order it would just scroll back at the top and do nothing. I repeated the process several times with no success. Please fix it! We are still in quarantine..."
"The way the app works and that it sets time out is crazy especially for an area that is small and not busy! Food is already made and ready to make per order but they wouldn‚Äôt make it right then instead send me away saying to come back when my time was set for, 30 minutes later! I could have ordered my food in the drive thru and been eating instead of typing this BAD review! For other food places I recommend the app but NOT Panda!! If could give NO stars I would."
When I arrived on time I was told to wait outside when my food was ready for pick up. I ended up waiting 10 min while the grub hub guy got his order. They could have just handed me my food when I arrived. The policy is only 2 at a time but she kept calling order #‚Äôs for people who did not pre order. So I never even was asked if my order was for pick up.
"I live right down the road from Panda Express but every time I try to get it delivered it‚Äôs not available. I‚Äôve tried at friends houses nearby as well. Clearly there is no delivery so I‚Äôm not why sure why they show it. Maybe because they have it in other areas? Still think when I selected my store they should say they don‚Äôt deliver. 

Gets my hopes up every time :("
"I love this app! Though not all locations are included, I have found ordering through this app to be such a time saver and oh so easy. Build a meal options or recommended meals are intuitive and easy to navigate. Pay in the app and then just pick up at the location. Definitely worth it"
"It‚Äôs very difficult to order what I want on the web site. When I order in store I get: a double Orange Chicken, double Angus Steak, double fried rice and a double chow mein. And it costs less than 20 dollars. 
I can‚Äôt even begin to place as order like that on line, end up ordering ala cart and it costs 36 dollars. 
The problem may be that I don‚Äôt understand how to use the web but there is no support for questions regarding ordering. 
Very poor set up!"
"Every time I use this app to order, it always takes forever to register my taps or swipes on the screen. It takes at least 5 seconds to register my tap, if it even registers it at all. I‚Äôve never had this problem with any other app before. It‚Äôs takes 3-4 times longer to make an order than it should. The only reason I still use the app to order is because I prefer ordering ahead. It‚Äôd be nice if this problem could be fixed."
I thought ordering on the app would save me time and be a lot faster for a better customer service. I was already on my way to Panda. I completed my order and I get a notification stating that my food was not going to be ready until 8:35!!! I placed the order at 8! As I walk into Panda and there is 1 person standing in line. If it wasn‚Äôt for the manager being able to locate my order I was told I would‚Äôve had to wait a half hour for my food. This system is so dumb.
"This app was great the first time we used it. Now it won‚Äôt accept our payment despite there being nothing wrong with our card, the number or the account. It says something about not being able to confirm if the card went through, so check email or call the store. The store never picks up, there‚Äôs no email, and our account shows no activity. 

Fix it!"
"Seriously, I order from this store about 1 time per week because of convenience. However, their app is terrible. It remembers nothing!!! I have to reload all information every time. It logs me out in the middle of an order. It makes me order through the online portal. Constantly tells me to change my password. It‚Äôs insane. Impossible to order while driving. With other restaurants, I can tap 3 or 4 screens and I am done. Easy. This app would pull cuss words out of Mother Teresa."
"Skip the app and go through the drive thru.  I have tried to order through the app five different times on five different days.  I get in a loop when I try to order rangoon. It won‚Äôt let me order them, then it won‚Äôt let me do anything else.  When I give up on the rangoon, close the app and start over,  it gives me an error message every time I try to check out.  So many other restaurants have this figured out, but I‚Äôm going to delete this app."
"I tried to order food through app (started at 6:05 pm) and it won‚Äôt let me choose 6:50 as pickup time (store closes at 7 pm). Then by the time I chose my order and went to checkout, it said need to change pickup time, but won‚Äôt let me pick any time. When tried to call, it says for orders go online or to app. VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. Local store people were so friendly, unfortunately the customer service taking orders online or on phone not working."
"Several times I‚Äôve tried to place an order on the app and got an error using my debit card. I‚Äôd try several times, each time I would have to re-input the card info. 

The next day, I find out that each order was processed and I had multiple pending charges on my account. Fortunately, their system or employees only let 1 charge go through. 

Today, I placed an order and realized that my card information had been saved each time and I is now listed in the application several times. (Sigh!). 

I keep going back because it‚Äôs wonderful food."
"Not user friendly. Doesn‚Äôt have a feature to add preferences/requests. Also, an online order forces you to go inside to pickup. Why?  Hello coronavirus! Social distancing! Then they missed including several items on the order. It‚Äôs printed out! Store was empty. one in the drive through and after 20 minutes still not ready. Put old soggy sweet fire chicken in the container. Called her on it and yet lo and behold. Soggy gummy chicken in the box! Your sole means of business is togo/drive through and it was screwed up royally. This is your survival!!"
This app has only worked for me one time. Every other time it either shuts down or doesn‚Äôt respond when I hit ‚Äúplace order‚Äù. And that‚Äôs if I even get that far. Often it struggles processing the payment. My payment method is current and after triple and quadruple checking the info entered the app still doesn‚Äôt work. No error message given. Just simply doesn‚Äôt respond. Says ‚Äúprocessing payment‚Äù then doesn‚Äôt proceed to the next screen nor does it give an error or explanation. Just sits there frozen.
"The app does its job. You can order food from it. It was an extreme hassle to do my first order. There‚Äôs an option to continue as a guest, however after entering in ALL of my information it prompted me again at the end to login or sign up. I had no choice but to sign up to continue. It also wouldn‚Äôt let me edit or customize entries. Even though there‚Äôs a button to do so... entire process took longer than it would have if I were to just drive to the store and order in person."
"Sorry Panda.  You had a great beginning with your app.  I could see the typical dishes available for the average restaurant, if not specials and items potentially available at my local restaurant that you advertise in your pictures.  I‚Äôm ok with that, however, attempted to place an order, and was asked for credit card info.  That‚Äôs already in Apple Pay.  Other restaurants accept that for payment, why don‚Äôt you?"
"Ordered three plates on the app for a pick up. One of the orders was incorrect so I went back and let them know that there was white rice in the box instead of chow mein.  I had to tell the person that I wanted what I ordered.  She took the bag away, brought it back, and said it was all set. When I got home I saw that the order was exactly the same...  Tossed in the bag upside down was a very small box of chow mein, which doesn‚Äôt even equal half of what it should have been.  Very disappointing...."
"This location works so hard to get your food to you as quick as they can. In the evenings, there‚Äôs always a line, so that makes the app online purchase very convenient. They offer a drink if they‚Äôre behind in an item and you have to wait. A very positive and friendly team!"
"The people who work at this location (Frisco-423)are so sweet! It was my sons birthday and they were about to close when I pulled up to order his favorite... the orange chicken at Panda Express. They didn‚Äôt have enough, so they made him fresh!... and gave him a cookie with a note that said Happy Birthday!"
"The food is delish. However, it‚Äôs annoying that I can only order 1 family meal per order. There are 10 of us in my family. 2 would work out nicely instead of me having piece the entire order together."
"The Panda Express is app is easy to use. I am able to order my favorite dishes as well as catering (Only wish they would add their soups). Best of all, I can pay for my order and then just pick-up my food when I arrive. Very convenient."
"After placing the order, Yep informed me that the store was running behind and my order would not be ready for 20 minutes. When I arrived they still had not started on it. 10 minutes later, that‚Äôs 30 minutes after the order was placed, I was still waiting for teriyaki chicken. I stood in line and watched as eight people placed their orders and walked through the line, which I could‚Äôve done if I had not already paid. Ditch the app and just walk up to the counter."
"Communication between app and store needs work. Placed order waited prescribed amount of time (20min) arrived at store for pick up staff claims order never came thru. Took an additional 8 min to get order. though, for an order that did not print up they fulfilled it correctly. Also unsure as to what staff needed from me I showed them the receipt page since that should have all the information she needs yet this seems to have aggravated her as she aggressively asked for the name on the order. Which I gave for a 2nd time."
Ordered and paid online. Supposed to be ready at 6:49 which was 1/2 hour after ordered. Went to pick up and they could not find order. Eventually found order still on computer. At 7:05. Not very organized with online orders. Still waiting and not all items ordered were available. 7:20 probably 10 people waiting for orders. Drive through line out on the main road. Need more staff and better system for putting out orders.
"Doesn‚Äôt matter where I use the ap or what sort of internet connection I have - this app runs incredibly slow. It‚Äôs better than the website at least, but probably has some kinks to iron out.

Would modify rating if it‚Äôs improved. Also, stores aren‚Äôt selling certain items anymore which I understand - but at least have them synch up with what‚Äôs actually available. 

 Best of luck."
"Why on earth would you only have the ability to have 2 items in shopping cart.  The as I try to add other items it just keeps replacing the last item in cart.  Really defeats the purpose of trying to save time and do mobile order. 

And once an item is in cart - should be able to be edited without having to remove it and start over.  

So much for using mobile/online order codes/coupons if you can‚Äôt even place your order.  Very disappointing."
I want to start by saying I love Panda! However I‚Äôve never been able to order online because I have always found it difficult to split the order as far as entrees and sides. e.g. chow mein and rice would only allow me to order 2 of either. Then my 3 entrees I could only pick 2 different or else it deletes one of the other two. Please fix this! I‚Äôm trying to make a catering order if possible
"Twice I have order on the app and the food was either wrong or not at all.  Double, triple check when you pick it up.  They do NOT refund through the app. 
Last night I had my daughter pick it up and they shorted me half my order. I called the store in which I live 30 miles from and was told they were to busy to deal with me and would call me back. I have never heard from them. Do not use the app!!!
The food portion are much smaller also."
"Truth is I had 5-6 different problem areas with the app and had to redo my order 8-9 times because of those, so I already wasted too much of my time on this to sit here and type out a detailed explanation of what those 5-6 problems were.  Suffice it to say that they were so frustrating; so much so that the last time I began the order I said to myself, ‚ÄúIf it doesn‚Äôt work this time, I‚Äôm quitting Panda and doing to Schlotsky‚Äôs!‚Äù  Fortunately, it finally worked that time."
"The app was working perfectly until the last update. My payment info and order history was not migrated. Also, now I have to login twice,  once with the app and once in the web browser. 
Why would you have an app, if the app takes you to the web browser to make your order. Everything was done easily through the application. 

This üëèüèª doesn‚Äôt üëèüèª make üëèüèª sense!"
It makes it so you can‚Äôt have your order right away even though it‚Äôs used like this a lot because of covid-19. It took 30 minutes to have it ready it and while I was checking my time if increase my time I waited for an hour and the employees didn‚Äôt even have my order ready when it was time to pick it up. It also didn‚Äôt tell me that the items I chose weren‚Äôt available at the restaurant I order from so it‚Äôs over all a bad app
Very easy to order online. Initially Not a great experience only because no  one called and let me know they were out of string beans. However Keria was very nice to apologize and try to find a substitution. She made everything better- will definitely order again solely based on her!
"this app is STUPID!! when you order ahead, it tells you the time that your order will be ready for pickup. i ordered around 1:45 and it said it would be ready around 1:55. i arrive at panda express right at 1:55 and they ask me for the time the app says the food will be ready, my name, and the order number in the app. then the employee says ‚Äúoh it‚Äôll be ready at 2:05‚Äù. i would‚Äôve gotten my food faster had i driven thru! i suggest that you just do that to save yourself the time and frustration."
For the FIRST time after using the online App for over several months my order was ready and fill correctly.  My compliments to the staff at the Decature Texas franchise. Well done. Especially while during a busy time of day.
"My order would not got through online, but was successful via the app. Only downside was that the final screen before placing my order did not show my desired pickup date/time, so to confirm, I went back a screen. Unfortunately, that deleted all my payment info. But nonetheless, so glad my order was finally placed :)"
"Please fix ‚Äúplace button‚Äù order, because no online orders go through. We went to the place they said never got it!!! We would like to be able to order the food and go, because the customer service in North Miami Beach is horrible, the worst I have experience, so avoiding them through online ordering is the only way we will eat Panda Express again. FYI, we tried multiple times with different orders and cards and nothing. Come on, this 2018, update your app please."
I ordered delivery last Friday and it was sent pretty quickly but 2 items were missing.  I have tried twice to contact them for a credit but the app seems to say I should get validated by captcha but there is no captcha available to do so
"The app is fine and much better than it used to be, but it needs more/better payment options. It should have Apple Pay support at the very least. Adding others like PayPal, Google, etc. would also be nice."
"Well thought out ordering system, but everything lags like crazy. Took me 10 minutes to place an order for 2 plates because every time you click something, it takes 10 seconds for the app to catch up. Then when you input your info (contact/payment info, etc) every third or so character you type takes a 5 second delay."
"The app is to slow. In here I can not even see what I am writing cause the background is white and the letters are white as well lol. But in general the app was taking forever to load.

Now I will just trust that this is understandable since I can not even read it.. I am tipping in blind .

Now, I am using the app cause in the computer on the website was giving me an error when I was trying to submit my payment.. I was about to give up.. but hey.. i really like your orange chicken :/"
I placed the order & got an alert they need more time before I pick up. I pushed ok and thought I was done. I went back before heading out to see my credit card info was wiped despite having saved it and order had not gone through.  I placed it again. Then got a text that door dash is delivering!store does not answer calls! Door dash said they are indeed bringing it despite my having ordered for pick up! Maybe all due to COVID but unclear!!!
"I‚Äôm sitting right outside the restaurant and it took over 24 minutes to place an order. It booted me out twice when putting my credit card info in which then I had to start over.  The pick up time kept changing, which I understand but then it made me reorder...crazy. Please change the light great information on this ordering sight to a black so it‚Äôs easily readable.  
Thank you."
"I tried to login in and place an order for pickup, but the app would not accept my existing password.  So I reset the password.   With a new password, the app still would not log me in to my account.  Then I tried placing an order as a guest, but I got an error message in the app that guest checkout wasn‚Äôt available, and to log in to place an order.   There are no words to describe the stupidity of the app.  
Panda Express must use the cheapest contractor to build and maintain the app."
I put a order in on the app for the ankeny location ... so I called The ankeny location to figure out what happened and they told me to call Merle hay location and have them transfer the order I said okay I can do that ..... long story short Merle hay wouldn‚Äôt transfer the order cause it would mess up there sales for the month so I doubt I will use that app again I should of just went to a small  restraunt they usually get my orders right every time !!
"This app would be awesome if it had the actual menu items on it. It NEVER has orange chicken or the honey walnut shrimp. I understand the shrimp is a sometimes limited time only thing, but orange chicken?  Come on. And when I call to ask, I just feel like an idiot. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs there, did you check here, here and here?‚Äù  Yes, yes I did. It‚Äôs not there. Yes, I‚Äôve checked for updates for the app.  Yes, I‚Äôve gone on the website instead. Still never has what I‚Äôm looking for. It frustrates me to the point I don‚Äôt even want to spend my money here."
Generally satisfied with the app but can‚Äôt use delivery as every time I add a sauce in the note section of The order I do not get it so a tab for sauce would make the experience much easier and better. No other notes as it is a well layer out app that is easy to use and navigate
"Either their service changed or their app broke. Either way, it is unfortunate what has happened. During a pandemic, is is nice to order your food and then wait in your car instead of in a line of people while it is prepared.
Today upon opening the app I find that I can no longer order using the app due to missing menu items, like The ability to order bowls or plates (√Ä la carte only), and errors when I try to order appetizers."
"I use the mobile app to skip to the front of the line, and every single time when I arrive my order hasn‚Äôt shown up yet.  The employees are completely unapologetic and say they can‚Äôt prepare my food until the order shows up.  Horrible."
"I have tried on at least 10 different occasions to place an order and it never works!  I kept thinking the app would get fixed but after having it for over a year and trying so many times, I‚Äôm done.  It seems so ridiculous that Panda Express can‚Äôt keep up with technology.  That lack of knowledge or lack of care - not sure which - now makes me worried about the safety of my credit card information when I pay in the store."
You really need to speed up the processing of your app. I ordered through the app a few minutes before showing up because I was in a hurry. Upon arrival I find out that your don‚Äôt get the online orders for about 10 minutes after the order is placed. And because I paid through the app the store will not just make my order so I can leave without it actually coming through the system. Will not be using this app ever again thanks for nothing
"My only annoyance with the app I have is that it doesn‚Äôt offer all of the juices and other drinks you have especially when you want to pair it together with a meal but there is no water available making you get it separately which is annoying but no juice selection beyond lemonade is even more so.

Otherwise I like the app."
"Boston market is one of my favorite restaurants. I am so glad that they came out with an app and they have updated it. But it has been six months since the last update, will you guys please update the app again, I am not able to sign up. Even though I agreed to the terms and conditions, the app will not allow me to sign up. Otherwise, I absolutely love this app. I look forward to using it, but for right now I will just use it as a guest until something is done about the sign up feature. Thank you"
"In general, I have only high praise to offer for this application and the overhaul it recently received. The interface and navigating experiences have received a fresh coat of paint and optimizations, and it‚Äôs far more aesthetically pleasing to use than before.

However, I can‚Äôt offer further praise or feedback because I cannot successfully place a carry-out order with it ‚Äî at all. Once I complete my order and proceed to the checkout, hitting the last confirmation before my order is sent, I‚Äôm given an error message stating that ‚Äúno or invalid authentication was provided with this request‚Äù. Nothing I have tried appears to fix this, and I can‚Äôt see where the authentication measures are failing, or even where they are present. My payment method information was completely correct, I was on a registered account, and my restaurant wasn‚Äôt near close. I‚Äôm stumped, but hoping it‚Äôs fixed soon so I can earn rewards!"
"Months ago, I reviewed this app and requested a gift card option be provided in the payment method portion. The request was granted, but adding a gift card disallowed my order from being placed yesterday (it said something like ‚Äúyou must call the restaurant to place the order‚Äù), which negated the point of picking it up quicker. When I got to the restaurant and checked out, the lady told me the app and website don‚Äôt allow gift cards to be applied to orders. Luckily, she was able to manually type in my gift card number (it was a digital version), but what good is it to have a gift card payment option on the app if it doesn‚Äôt function properly? Please correct; otherwise, this is a smooth app to navigate. Thanks."
"Ordering through the app was pretty good. I am a visual person so I was happy there were pictures for every item. I decided to try the curbside feature instead of normal pickup. When I pulled up the the restaurant I sat there for about 10-15 minutes before just walking inside. An employee even walked outside to take a smoke break and just kept going like I wasn‚Äôt in the designated spot for curbside pick up. There needs to be a button or procedure that notifies the employees when someone is outside for an order. Not to be the ‚Äúlazy customer‚Äù who is just complaining about having to walk, I just feel like if the curbside feature is offered there should be some follow through... also the second time they have failed to give me a drink with my kids meal"
"After using this app for about a year now I finally decided to use some of my rewards that I THOUGHT I had.  Problem is that it was showing a zero balance and I was logged in correctly.  No record of my prior purchases.

Second, many times the app is not working very good so I go into the restaurant to order - which at times far faster than the app.   However if you don‚Äôt go thru the app, no way to earn rewards.

Lastly, the app allows you to order after hours - so if the restaurant closes early for one reason or another, you can still order and by the time you waste the driving to the restaurant, you find out it could have closed a couple of hours earlier.   Many other restaurant apps tell you if the restaurant is open or not and if you have a small time window to pick up."
"This app requires you to set a password that is exactly 8 characters. Most password managers including the built-in Safari password manager on iOS auto-create passwords that are much longer than 8 characters. App needs to be more friendly to people who use password managers. 

All apps that accept payment need to take ApplePay. I‚Äôm tired of having to send my credit card information through to store in an app. This simply isn‚Äôt that secure. Too many apps lose data, and at least with ApplePay I know that Apple‚Äôs hardware encryption and trusted  APIs are managing my payment. It‚Äôs long past time for companies to get over their problems with contactless payments and to use the default one on their mobile device."
"In there attempt to make the menu system simple they actually made it far more confusing then it needed to be, but I can forgive a poor UI. What I can‚Äôt forgive is the constant bait and switch offers, $3 pot pie sure sounds great, open the app and they have never heard of this offer. Great offers in the  notifications menu but imposible to redeem them in the app. If you dont write the coupon codes down they disappear when they are applicable. Rewards are nice and yes there are some exclusive menu items and an after dark menu but I‚Äôm sick of companies that make offers just to have you open the app and not follow through or make it so difficult to redeem that you just give up and decide to pickup some Popeyes‚Ä¶.hmm good idea think I‚Äôll do that."
"I‚Äôm not joking.... this app is probably the best thing since sliced bread. You can order your favorite bowl or plate of food within seconds. The app is very simple and offers all the extra options like customizing your order the way you like it. I love adding gravy to my market bowl at the end and on top of everything and I added that in the notes. Guess what?! 
The gravy was on top just how I like it. Yeah it depends on the person who takes care of your order but that way Boston Market setup the app it‚Äôs made to be catered to us customers. Way to go!!!
It‚Äôs also very convenient for when you forget your card at home and they don‚Äôt have Apple Pay in the store yet so just other the food via phone and pay with Your phone.
You also get to use their point reward system!!!! Finally being rewarded to be a loyal customer!!!

Best thing since sliced bread and I mean it!üçû"
"Loved using this app to order a dinner for my son‚Äôs cross country team. It saved me time from my busy schedule and I was able to order the dinner for 30 kids in less than 10 minutes. When I went to pick up my order everything was all set and the kids loved it. I will be using this app often. It makes my life easier and we love the food. Also, excited about the rewards I‚Äôm earning every time I use the app."
"The point of an app is convenience. Having to re-enter orders 5-6 times to STILL not be able to place an order is ANYTHING but convenient. It asks you to enter your vehicle information endlessly, NEVER allowing you to move forward with order (this is third attempt at third visit since putting the app on phone). Of course employees don‚Äôt understand how to use app so I still have to wait in drive through line to place order. And, the promo codes it pushes to you aren‚Äôt recognized by the same app that pushes it to you. Such a joke and waste of my time! It motivates me to keep driving to one of the other establishments to eat that has apps which work seamlessly. Get it together man!!"
"I don‚Äôt typically phone ahead when going to Boston Market so I need to key in my receipt information manually according to my server. However I do not find this process to be user friendly. First I have trouble finding the right page. Then, I am not allowed to key the information in on the same day of the visit. You have to key the information in a certain way or you get an error message. Then, after going through all of that, it still does not go through. This process needs to be greatly improved."
"The new interface looks great. However, I have not been able to get the reward points for multiple transactions. Have tried contacting support, who responded with multiple curt messages asking me to refresh and reload my app, which did not work, instead of actually trying to figure out what the issue is with my account. Horrible customer service that has failed to fix a simple issue."
"I don‚Äôt leave reviews normally but this rewards app is horrible. Every time I get a reward ,it expires! Had a welcome reward, was about to claim it on the app, went to another app real quick to do something, came back and it disappeared! Said I had no reward to claim. Few weeks later, Had received my birthday reward for free dessert... said it it expired on the 18th of August, which means the 18th is the last day I can claim it....POOF!!! GONE!!!! Went to order food and claim my dessert & it wasn‚Äôt there. Not cool! They need to fix the reward claiming process. Other than, the app works well...but what‚Äôs the point if I can‚Äôt claim the reward that‚Äôs mine & that I‚Äôve earned. Thumbs down!"
"This app is not only easy to navigate, but also gives the user the ability to order ahead as well as take advantage of the rewards program. I enjoy using this app to order ahead and my food will be ready by the time I get to the store. So far have been able to get several deals using the rewards program which is a great bonus for something I was buying anyways!"
Honestly Boston Market is one of my favorite restaurants to order from because of its kind employees and great customer service and of course the amazing food!!! I live in a school bus and in the middle of making it a tiny home so Boston Market gives me the sense of a great home cooked meal after a long day of work. Sitting down at home with family.. it reminds me of home.
"So far, the app seems rather stable but the menu layout could use some revisions. The app looks rather plain and the ordering process can be a little cumbersome. There also seem to be some UI bugs that change the screen size.

Overall, the transaction was easy and once you get the hang of their ordering process, it is simple to use. Some minor tweaks could go a long way to make this a better app."
This is not the first time I‚Äôve ordered for curbside and had to go in to get my food since I waited 10 minutes after the time it said it would be ready. The food is good enough for fast food ‚Äúhome style‚Äù. The order was incorrect but tasted fine. The person behind the counter finally acknowledged my presence but was distracted by his earbuds. The food was ready but not brought to me. Yes I know this is totally a first world problem but don‚Äôt offer a service if you‚Äôre not going to provide it.
"I order on line and pick up for home consumption. The last 4 orders have included one of their full size desserts but for some reason the person fulfilling the order only put a slice in so I‚Äôve had to correct them each time.

In general they get it right and the food is very good. An individual meal can provide more than one serving which is perfect for someone living alone but who works on an on-call basis."
I placed an order on the app and accidentally pressed pickup instead of delivery. I called the store and they said to call doordash who could switch my order to delivery. The doordash rep said they can‚Äôt do that on their end but they were nice enough to call the store and try to resolve the issue. The Boston Market rep ended up having to call their IT department to cancel my order and I had to place a new order. All of this back and forth could have been easily resolved with a cancel order button.
Uninstalling because the one thing that I would love to order online or through Grubhub you don‚Äôt even have on as an option which is the prime rib. Another problem is that you can‚Äôt get rewards if you walk in and order. I just spent almost $100 on 5 individual prime rib meals for my family because there‚Äôs no prime rib family meal offered and no rewards for in store pirchase...it all has to be ordered online.
"I just used this for the first time and felt ordering was a breeze, menu items and additional options were easy to find and within 1 min of pulling into spot my food was brought out. If you allow the app to view your location they know exactly when you pull in. Loved this app far better than Papa Johns, Pizza Hut and others in their category!"
"Boston Market app is so easy and flexible. I prefer restaurants with good apps so I get exactly what I want without stress. 

The food options are very diverse, so I can order often and get different foods. Everything is tasty. Most restaurants have few vegetable options, so I always order extra from Boston Market to have with other foods. 

I found using delivery service is much faster than I can go to Boston Market, order my food and immediately come back. 

The rewards build up quickly and have great options for redeeming them. I think I will take the $20 off today with my rewards!"
"The app is easy to use, until it comes to the payment.  The app no longer offers the ability to use a gift card for payment.  Neither does it allow the order to be processed in the app with an option for payment to be made upon arrival in store. Its poor judgement to eliminate this functionality during a pandemic. We are ordering in the app, to eliminate the need to enter the building to keep employees and customers safe.  We will avoid Boston Market during this time."
"I used the app today to order an early thanksgiving meal from the Tustin store for my mother to enjoy with our family. I received a confirmation email and my credit card was charged. When we called a bit before we arrived, we were informed that they were closed because they didn‚Äôt have water and that they didn‚Äôt receive our order. We went to another Boston Market (Costa Mesa) who assisted us with our order. Our lunch was an hour late and we were still charged for the first order..... so this app wasn‚Äôt so useful for me today."
"This is one of the easier to use online ordering apps I‚Äôve used, and I like that I can save my go-to orders and reorder them quickly. Boston Market‚Äôs rewards program is new, and I love it. I already got a free cookie, and I like that I can choose what reward I want rather than the restaurant deciding for me. (That‚Äôs my big issue with myPanera). I‚Äôm saving up for a free Pot Pie. :)"
"Really surprised how well made the app is, the only thing that would be nice is a check in feature to notify the store that you have arrived for curbside pickup and an order status button (even if it was artificial just a timer would be nice). Otherwise the app was really excellent!"
"The chicken is awesome. I haven‚Äôt tried many of the different sauces or meats, however the Mac and Cheese could use a little more work. The mixed veggies are awesome and the corn. The portion size is not to great for what is charged. The only reason I think people keep coming back is that the is healthy and flavorful. This is just my opinion"
"Everything works under control, except the delivery driver didn‚Äôt ring the bell when he/she delivered the food on the doorstep. I didn‚Äôt even noticed whether he/she came to our doorstep. lol. But, I liked how he/she left the food on the doorstep to avoid the contact, due to COVID-19. Keep it up the good work guys!"
"Not getting credit (reward points) for some purchases.  Have followed their instructions to log out, wait 5 minutes, log back in.  No points after waiting 4 days to log back in.  Attempted to contact BM through different avenues, absolutely no response.  Crickets!
Entered DOB incorrectly, app will not allow oneself to edit.  Reached out for help, they replied that they had edited, but have not, still the same and never received birthday reward.  
Huge headache, I‚Äôll shop where I get rewards for my purchases and my feedback is heard."
To say it simply it‚Äôs easy! App is easy to use & delivery is always quick! Points build up when you use the app which allows you to get free food & at a time when $$ is super tight a night of feeding my family goes a long way!
"This app allows you to order food for delivery. However, if you only receive half your order, good luck trying to reach them about it. The restaurant doesn‚Äôt answer their phone, and there‚Äôs no where on the app to report issues. If you choose ‚Äúcontact us‚Äù, it takes you online to create an account. But I have an account, let me sign in. Sign in, then click ‚Äúcontact us‚Äù, takes you back to create an account. An endless circle and cheated out of half my order."
I‚Äôm not interested in knocking the app but if you want to make it better look at the chipotle app. You should have a barcode to help keep track of rewards. If the cashier doesn‚Äôt ask when you check out ( and they don‚Äôt) you have to remind them. Hopefully they‚Äôll get it right but that is doubtful. Youre  missing a big opportunity here. Time to get it right.
"The first time I tried ordering through the App I made it through the payment, even received an alert text from my bank for the charge. Went to the restaurant and was informed they never received my order. Had to reorder while there and my total was $3 less in store, than online for the same thing? Eventually the online charge was credited to my account. Tried ordering through the App a second time and it keeps crashing on me. Usually never write reviews, so that says something about this App."
Boston Market rewards program is better than others because you can redeem points for either free food or just get $10 or $20 off orders.  A lot of options unlike others that just give you one choice.
"The food and customer were great as always! On the all however, it doesn‚Äôt give any way to let the store know you‚Äôre there to pick up the order. Thats the only concern I have. Otherwise thank you."
"I have never seen an app where you can‚Äôt minus or add ingredients such as don‚Äôt add lettuce or please add gravy. The special instructions box is so character limited it‚Äôs pointless. Then if you try to pay, you‚Äôll randomly get errors like the pay sum is different than the total even though the app calculates both and you have zero say. Unfortunately the Boston Market by me is online order only and they‚Äôve lost a 24 year customer due to aterrible app and service."
"The app itself worked fine, but it didn‚Äôt expedite the ordering process at all! The fastest I could get an order complete it with asked asap, 20 minutes. I arrived after the time it said my order should be ready. Not only was it not ready, but they told me it needed to be prepared and the wait staff was very rude. There was no skip the line option. And then I waited over 20 minutes for them to prepare it. To top it all off, they would‚Äôve gotten my order incorrect, if I hadn‚Äôt caught it. Terrible experience!"
"I placed an order and the order never went through, yet the money was removed my account. There is no record in their system for the order and no way to get a refund. Currently still waiting if someone will return my call to assist, but as of now, I am out of the money and left to suffer. The app states the order was fulfilled yet in store there is no proof and forces me to be out of the money and wait to maybe have someone reach out. May update late."
The prices on the app are higher than the store. I thought this was an error no they respond to me and explain it‚Äôs done on purpose for deliver orders like door dash. I did a take out order and was infuriated when they didn‚Äôt have it ready and didn‚Äôt have items I paid for. What‚Äôs worse is they would only reimburse me the items value for the in store price. As far as I‚Äôm concerned they stole almost ten dollars from me on a family order and not so much as a we‚Äôre sorry
"‚ÄúThe sum of your selected payment methods must equal the order total.‚Äù There‚Äôs not even a way to edit the amount. I simply added a credit card and tried to place the order. The amount shows up as negative the order total under my credit card on the checkout screen. What? Long story short, app doesn‚Äôt work üëéüèª

Seeing I‚Äôm not the first one to experience this issue. It was reported over a YEAR ago üòæ"
"Every Thanksgiving when I‚Äôm away from family, I come here and order practically everything. The turkey, the sides, and the desserts all were fresh, hot, and yummy. I only wish you had the complete seasonal menu on your app. For example, I had to call the store to see if there was pecan and pumpkin pie (there was)."
"App was easy and very quick. But getting to the store the screen says ready, app says ready, and the workers are all standing there with no order ready. First time online ordering and sad to say it‚Äôs done for the convenience and fast service and I did not get that today. Will be hesitant to even come here again, and I haven‚Äôt been in years! Looks like will be more years...."
I love my Boston Market with the exception of curbside. I placed the order while at work which is 30 minutes away pulled up and still had to wait another 19 minutes for my food to come out. It‚Äôs quicker just to do drive thru.
"App requires you to enter a credit card to save with Boston Market, will not accept credit cards already stored on phone or apple pay. Also no ability to support apple pay in stores for whatever reason.

No ability to order prime rib through app even when you can visually confirm the location has prime rib. Staff not empowered to work around these issues in store. I guess I'll just hold onto my money until BM decides to join us in the current day."
"While the app is great for placing your order, the biggest hurdle is when you try to do curbside pickup. You call the seemingly local number to let them you‚Äôre here, and have to navigate a phone tree. Then the line just rings and no one from the store answers."
We‚Äôve been ordering our Boston Market food for years now.   The high quality of its home cooked taste makes us happy.   We will continue being a huge fan & frequent this fine establishment !  Thankyou so much .
My family and I order boston market very often and it‚Äôs so easy to order using the app the service and food is top notch! define let recommend ordering from them!
"We had both a coupon for a BOGO and in the order it said we should get a free meal under $12. We had one for $11 and change. No matter what we did, the app would not give use our free meal. Keep saying we had no qualifying items. It was the right amount and the right date.

App needs work."
Horriable app.  There is no option for putting in a gift card.  Every time I order it takes my credit card and when I go to the store to get a credit back to use the giftcard instead they refuse saying that payment has already been made.  It is like they want you to not use their gift cards.  Please fix and add an option to use payment of a giftcard or pay at store with it.
Did my first order and get a call that they ran out of corn how does that happen by 4:30‚Ä¶.. and no other vegetables that the grand kids would eat very disappointed‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
The old app was fine but the new one is much easier to use.  Funny comments on the menu too.  Also can use your gift card which you couldn‚Äôt before.  Love the Chicken Button.
"It‚Äôs a little bit of a pain to figure out how to start the ordering process unless I always get the same thing, which I won‚Äôt. Other than that I‚Äôm loving every other part of this app!"
Pretty fresh when the food is cooked correctly but some locations drop the ball. I enjoy the app but there doesn‚Äôt seem to be a way o add rewards after purchasing; their best features are the text messaged coupons.
"Whenever I had a food reward to redeem on the BM app it always went through. But for some odd reason I was trying to redeem a free half chicken meal but when I press the checkout button it says ‚ÄúError, no applicable item to reward/redeem. I had exactly 95 points to redeem the free meal. I never had an issue ordering through the app till today. Please fix this. I don‚Äôt want my redeemed reward to expire."
"Yesterday my son and I went to store 1430 in Ormond beach,Fl the crew and manager were so helpful,knowledgeable and friendly. We felt so welcome. Juan  and the young lady that was there were like family. They both are truly an asset to your company and the community thankyou Gloria Casola the time of day was 3:53"
"We enjoy the email and text messages for coupons for family meals and limited choices. 
The quality and our preferred store personal has been very good.
Lonnie&Sherry Perry"
"Ordering is pretty simple, but personal info on the app doesn‚Äôt match the website. And certain items can‚Äôt be edited once the info has been entered. My birthday is wrong and can‚Äôt be changed. This app and the website need some basic QA."
There have been times where I was in the neighborhood and wanted to stop in but then I would have to sit in the parking lot filling out everything that I wanted when I could have gone inside and the process would‚Äôve been a lot quicker
"I get a notification saying but one get one free - click to screenshot.  I click and it brings up the app with no mention of the offer.  Since my notifications are set as temporary, it‚Äôs no longer available either.  Not exactly bait and switch but bait and yank away the offer."
"After ordering, I never receive rewards points despite being logged in. When you contact them for support they gaslight you. They make you feel as though you did something wrong regardless of proof. They need to overhaul their rewards program. After reading recent reviews, I see I'm not the only one with the issue."
"Thank you for having a store in Meyerland. I love going in because all I get is smiles. All of the ladies know me and you get number one treatment.  What is so good about it is they know what I want. Thank you beautiful Ladies. 
Ms. Annie"
"I like this app and love ordering from Boston Market, but I have to order using their website to choose my own tip. When checking out using the app, the only four options for tipping the delivery person are :
None
10%
15% or 
20% of the food total. 
However, during the pandemic I have wanted to tip more than 20% because of the risk taken on by the delivery person. On the website, I can choose to apply whatever tip I want. Until this is changed, I will have to keep ordering from the website."
I tried to buy two Mac and cheese 1 rice and one steamed veggies. You can only check each item that you want. When you get to the quantity Nav page the option to select which items you want to increase is not available. They kept trying to give me 2 steamed Veges. Lol
"I had the meat loaf. Portions 5 star. Mack and cheese goo. Sweet caporal, my favorite. Work with your marketing group to overwhelm the general public and ME üëÄ."
Got an error message trying to add rewards. Ended up paying full price for both meals. App does take Apple Pay. I‚Äôm trying to limit who has access to my card numbers and apps like yours make that difficult get with it. 10 years since we've been to one of your restaurants and your app is the first encounter and it‚Äôs not good.
"It is without hesitation that I would recommend this particular Boston Market on Queens Blvd. just off 50th Street in Woodside, Queens. I‚Äôve been a patron of the restaurant for almost a decade. The staff is always warm and inviting. They make special request with an exuberant ease. There has never been a visit that I left feeling unsatisfied. Keep it up guys. I‚Äôm actually stopping in today to get a meat combo to drop off at my moms in Clinton Hill, BK for Mother‚Äôs Day. 

Cheers, 

DAH
Maspeth, NY"
Left my wallet at work on my lunch break. Princess walked me thru the order online process and got the food started for me while I placed the order. Was on limited time so i really appreciated it. Thanks again princess
"I love an app that is simple and to the point. This app is easy to use, very intuitive overall and results in a Great meal for my family! Way to go Boston Market!"
I ordered dinner for Christmas Eve through Boston market in Fairless Hills Pennsylvania‚Ä¶ It was the worst from start to finish‚Ä¶ From over an hour late‚Ä¶ under cooked turkey‚Ä¶ And cold corn‚Ä¶ What a joke and what a waste of $340‚Ä¶ I wouldn‚Äôt eat or order again from Boston market if it was free‚Ä¶ If your dinner matters to you and you have people over you are taking a big chance ordering from Boston Market
If you want something that‚Äôs very fresh stick to Boston market I love their food I‚Äôve been eating their food for about 20 years now‚ô•Ô∏èüëè
I found the local Store does not give the true value of the dinner. Twice I ordered 1/2 a chicken and received 2pieces of chicken which was not 2 quarters. I feel I am being deceived and really don‚Äôt like going there. My girlfriend feels the same way
"App to order food but cant even use gift cards to pay.
No option to pay at the door either. These options used to exist on web but got removed. Gift card payment option should be added. That‚Äôs what gift cards are created for."
It‚Äôs so easy to use I can order from home and go pick it up without waiting in line!ü•∞üòçüôåüèªüíú
New app is much better and has a rewards program.   You can even get a full Thanksgiving Meal for free.  Really great rewards if you are a Boston market fan.
"I have tried unsuccessfully over a year to get this app to work but at checkout no matter what card I use, it always gives the error ‚Äúthe sum of payment methods must equal order total‚Äù, and the order never goes through. Every time. I always have to end up using other delivery apps or dining elsewhere."
I previously made a purchase and partially used a gift card. Trying to use the app to place another order and am getting an error message for both new gift cards. Called the gift card number and confirmed their full balances. But can‚Äôt use the new gift cards with the old. What is the issue???
"I have deleted this app from my phone. Tired of wasting my time putting in an order only to get to the final stage and have it tell me ‚Äúwe are unable to accept your order. Please visit your local restaurant.‚Äù

Boston Market, your food is good but you app is essentially worthless if it cannot perform the one task for which I use it."
App is good but it has something missing. I like baked Cod Fish on Friday and it‚Äôs not available in the app. Also Apple pie is not available. Also I cannot add my 55 years and older discount. That‚Äôs why I no longer use this app. I place my order in person in the restaurant. üò¢
"After completing an order, I could not submit it, getting some kind of authentication error. The app appears to have been updated; before it worked flawlessly. I ended up phoning in my order, and the person I spoke to said that a lot of customers have been getting similar errors. It will be awhile before I use this app again."
"I bought a Boston Market eGift card from a Boston Market email offer. The app let me put all the info in but when I try to place the order, it just says ‚ÄúError‚Äù, ‚ÄúYour order could not be placed. Please call the location directly to place your order.‚Äù
Something more meaningful would be helpful."
"Love Boston Market. Get home cooked type food quickly. Sides are great, main course options are great..best sweet potatoes around. Bring back the squash casserole!!"
"Every time I receive a notification on my phone for a coupon and click on it, I get an error message. The alleged coupon doesn‚Äôt show up on the app and the notification is gone. Also, I haven‚Äôt been able to order in the app. Waste of time."
I order my food and it was bad first of all turkey was small piece which I don‚Äôt mind because I have the gastric bypass but the salad looks old not fresh and the cream of Spinach looked like it was the button of the pot and it looks like it been their for a while and was packed bad I will never order from this boston market again. In Yonkers
I love the food I just want to make it as easy as possible to order and have it picked up or delivered seems like that happens OK so far
"Installed the app because my family regularly visits Boston Market. 

Each time I go I give the cashier my phone number so the purchase will be credited to my rewards. The receipt indicates how many points you have earned 

To date, I have never received any reward points on the app. The phone number associated with the app is the same one given with each visit.  

My Thanksgiving and Christmas orders, as well as my monthly family orders over the past year were never credited.  A few hundred dollars. 

Skip the app it only get 1 star because there is no 0 star, and just enjoy the food which gets 5 stars."
The app doesn't accept Boston Market gift cards when ordering and there's also no option to pay at pickup so gift cards just can't be used for mobile orders. Seems like a major item to miss for a fast food ordering app.
"I see the app changed a bit.  I headed in, took a while to get the login to work but once in, I apparently had to start over on my profile.  About to click on order and the app crashed.  Yikes."
I received an e gift card from a friend. Couldn‚Äôt use it on the app. I checked it online and the card has $50 on it but the app won‚Äôt let me use it. Called the local store and they couldn‚Äôt help. I‚Äôm disabled and can‚Äôt get there to use the gift card. So Boston Market has my $50 and I have no food. Thanks for nothing.
"It‚Äôs sad so many of my old time favs are just wasting away. Not many BM in my area, but I was happy to see they had an app as well as delivery service. 

Well, I tried creating an account but it took 24hrs to register to their system, but I still couldn‚Äôt log in. I uninstalled / reinstalled app still nothing. Just give it up,"
I like to place orders for curbside pickup but the app is missing a check in feature.  The staff tells me I should be able to indicate I‚Äôve arrived (it does ask me what my car looks like) but it doesn‚Äôt have anything to do that.
Makes ordering super easy! I use the reorder which is like 3 clicks. Plus I can track my rewards on the app too. Makes the experience overall great.
"Decent app, not the best, not the worst I‚Äôve used as far as restaurant apps go. I really wish you could use a Boston Market gift card as payment in the app or even ApplePay."
Great service. Quite packed but everyone was trying hard. Working hard as a teamüëçüèºüòÄ
I keep receiving an error message saying sun of payment method must equal sum of order total. However I‚Äôve verified with my bank that my card is active and working and that there is plenty of funds for my order.   First time user and was ordering Thanksgiving dinner I‚Äôm Very disappointed.
"Yesterday It was my last order from Boston market . The app is terrible slow no tracking order, only show ready in about one hour then it took more than 2 hours to finally get the meal, it‚Äôs cold taste like left over food from overnight.
Deleted the app right away from my phone and go to Chick-fil-a for a fresh chicken."
"The app was easy to maneuver, I could even use a coupon!  The pick up was fast & food was delicious!"
"They need to fix the fact that you can‚Äôt customize, like the carver sandwiches. Nowhere to click ‚Äúno lettuce‚Äù. Overall, not bad."
The app is so easy to use but I do wish the app offered more available coupons.
"Ordered online for 2 dinners and when I chose 4 sides it only listed 2 items (+added sides)had to call and clarify which sides. Lucky I did, both ‚Äúitems added‚Äùwere wrong...

Don‚Äôt make it so complicated!"
"I tried to order ahead for pickup, and it keeps telling me my selected payment methods must equal total. I KNOW THEY DO THAT ALREADY! Not the first time it‚Äôs happened, so from now on if you‚Äôre in a hurry for picking up meal, don‚Äôt use app. Allow time to go in and place order."
So far so good. I have used it twice. Not a problem. Will use again
Shocker!  Second time in a row I arrived to pick up my order and they didn‚Äôt have it.  Today was a 43 minute wait for chicken.  Chicken?  Isn‚Äôt that all you do?  Last time using this app.  It never tells you not available.  They don‚Äôt tell you until you drive there.
"Easy to use, laid out really well, ordering and payment are convenient."
"Never able to use the promo codes, takes FOREVER to load and order. I wouldn‚Äôt use it except I hate to go there and wait for them to prepare the order. Usually by the time I am finished ordering, there‚Äôs a glitch
And I have to reload the page and re-order. Too time consuming. Can‚Äôt order Cod on Fridays on the app. Nor prime rib."
I was able to order my food but when I went to add to bag on certain items it told me to select a sauce and there was no place to do so. Other than that it‚Äôs a good app.
You build up points to get coupons. The coupons always have an ‚Äúerror‚Äù when you try to apply to your order. Then it won‚Äôt give you the points back even though you didn‚Äôt get to use it
"I can‚Äôt check out. It keeps bouncing back to the pop up asking for the car description and won‚Äôt let me get past that. 
I tried the website and it doesn‚Äôt offer curbside as an option and it wouldn‚Äôt let me log in."
I would love if the app would allow you to designate the pick up time... a delayed pickup would be nice.
Works great user-friendly
Payment types do not allow gift cards???? You can buy them but not use them! Thank you!
"When I try to enter vehicle info for curbside, it will not take the info. I click save and it immediately opens the vehicle modal again. It‚Äôs a loop. Very frustrating."
"Please put prime rib on the menu, I know that you only have after 4:00PM, you can put the note on the item that, only available at 4:00 PM! You prime rib is good!"
There is no customer service to call how the points system works. I don‚Äôt see anyplace on the app how it works. So for now I am using the coupons buy one get one free. The only thing is good to eat is the chicken and the pot pies. Also why isn‚Äôt any hot beverages to drink?
"Very arduous process use. Makes you fill out a long registration form. Them makes you manually type your credit card. No Apple Pay. If you try to curbside pickup there is no communication that it is coming or not. 

Try to order something. Painful."
Always good and delicious!!  Look forward to having a wonderful meal coming here!
I‚Äôve never been able to actually place an order through this app because it always crashes when I add something to my order. I‚Äôve tried uninstalling/reinstalling and nothing works. Why have a rewards app if it doesn‚Äôt work?
"Easy to order, but what‚Äôs the difference between reg and large mashed potatoes? You won‚Äôt be able to tell. Come on, Boston market... your customers should be able to see serving size and nutrition information."
"I love the food at Boston Market. It is what I like to make when I cook. (Except I don‚Äôt have a rotisserie.)

The prices are reasonable and the options are great."
Is not easy to see how to use points prior to paying
I‚Äôve purchased in store a couple times and haven‚Äôt received any points in the app
Favorite restaurant! I eat here all the time and I love that I can get free food now from rewards!
Order was pre place should have been ready at 6:34pm it is now 7:06pm and I am still waiting...
There is no way to pay with a gift certificate when ordering online which makes zero ‚Äúcents‚Äù. I‚Äôm sure I would order more if they had this option since I have a bunch of gift cards.
"i ordered a meal for delivery off of the boston market app, 30 mins after the expected delivery time my food still had not come so i called the store. they said that the delivery is routed through grubhub or door dash and they have nothing to do with it. so i never got the food, couldn‚Äôt contact the driver, and boston market couldn‚Äôt cancel the charge bc it went through another company. had to dispute with my credit card. just order through grubhub"
I just love the quality and freshness of the food. The BOGO specials are nice too üòâ
Have to wait additional 10 minutes after promised time to pickup order.
Easy and convenient
Since I am a disabled 86 year old veteran I had a friend go and pick up the order when she got there she was told that hey were out no more Boston Market for me. Why place an order and dont get it?
I check out and enter my car and it keeps popping up the car selection. Wasted 20 minutes.
"Incredibly, Boston Market refrained their app and made it WORSE. Hard to figure out how to order anything, and still can‚Äôt order prime rib and other specialty dishes through the app. Not sure what the point is of the redesign, they must have extra money to spend or something."
Only 1 restaurant in area. Whenever you try to order from the 3rd St. and Bell location the app says unable to contact restaurant. Not going to drive 7-8 miles to a restaurant and not know if they have what we want or even if it‚Äôs still on open restaurant. They‚Äôve closed most in Phoenix AZ.
"It‚Äôs great to order ahead and pick up with out a wait. However, need option for sauce on the side."
"Boston Market is healthy, served fast and nothing but a great menu!!!"
"When ordering the rotisserie chicken, you do not have an option for half dark, or quarter dark selection. There‚Äôs only half rotisserie"
I didn‚Äôt know I need to mention my phone number when I order from the restaurant. And I tried to claim points using the receipts afterward. It keeps saying the information I enter does not match. Help please!!!
Ok so I need this fixed or I can‚Äôt order any food. It says the sum of your order must be equal to the amount paid. It makes no sense . As of now I can‚Äôt get food.
"They were so fast, accurate, and courteous. The food was very delicious. I love this place."
Online pricing is higher than store price. I try to order food ahead online for pickup and the price I‚Äôm charged 10-20% higher than the store price. What kind me of scam is that?  I shouldn‚Äôt be charged extra for ordering ahead!
"Boston Market, is my ‚Äúgo-to‚Äù when I don‚Äôt want to cook."
All workers are very welcome ant the food is delicious I totally recommend it thanks
Wonderful place delicious food
Read the title. Look at their app and do that. Not too hard to business correctly here. Doesn‚Äôt take too much brain power to see how you copy their rewards plan but execute it way worse
"I should be able to pay with a gift card, or at least choose to pay in-store so I can use it then."
"Would be pretty good, but when I go to enter my car info, it won't accept it. It's a Ford Focus, nothing exotic. Should not be a bug still at this point."
Otherwise a good app. Easy to use.
"I have tried to notify the company about app issues, no luck."
"BostonMarket is suffering from this pandemic with not so good food, but it‚Äôs acceptable. Didn‚Äôt get cornbread for some reason. Still, enjoined."
They really shouldn‚Äôt make curbside an option if the store is not staffed to provide this service. I could have gotten my order faster standing in line.
Arrived at location to pickup my online order.  Told me they are out of meatloaf and I had to wait 30 minutes for it.  This kind of service is unacceptable.  And on top of that they didn‚Äôt even apologize for the wait!
The app prices have gone up two dollars since the beginning of the year - it‚Äôs cheaper to order in the store - if the app continuity charge additional money I won‚Äôt be using it - chicken in the store is 9 something app charges almost 11
love the idea but list Prime rib also and let the customer ordering have option to call and speak to some one also about there order being placed as kids allergies and what sizes the side orders we want..
"This app only passed my order to Doordash, but when it didn‚Äôt show up they both pointed fingers at one another. You‚Äôre better off ordering through Doordash or another food delivery app."
"The app is fine. But somehow whenever I order online and go to pick it up, it‚Äôs a crapshoot if they‚Äôve lost the order. Or if it‚Äôs ready.  They need better implementation. Pottstown, Pa location."
"This has got to be the worst app for a major restaurant chain by far. Absolutely horrible. 

Account creation or login is a mess. It doesn‚Äôt tie in to iCloud passwords which has you scurrying to create a password suitable for pentagon clearance. 

I‚Äôve skipped this app and probably Boston Market altogether."
"Delicious variety, always fresh and tasty. Not overly salted. Friendly help."
Waste of time..... asks for your car make and model for curbside and never continues...hit submit and it asks for car make and model again.
"Very good food, excelente service and very clean and sanitized environment."
"I can never place an order through the app because it says ‚Äúoperation time out‚Äù after a minute of loading, yet they charge me for it"
So easy to use for order pkacement.
When trying to view the cart or being sent to the cart the app crashes. Reinstalling and restarting my phone do nothing to fix this issue.
Gray service
You only get rewards if you order on the app. This is basic functionality. Don‚Äôt waste your time until this is fixed.
"The title says it all. It won‚Äôt allow me to sign up, and when I create an account it won‚Äôt let me sign in or change my password. This app is garbage."
"Although I enjoy visiting BM, the app does not work in recording points for purchases. I have visited BM several times and no cashier or manager has even been able to get this to work. Very disappointing. Help??"
"Beware, you cannot cancel your order through the app. If you are at a store waiting an hour for your food like I was, they can‚Äôt refund you (unless they were just incompetent on all aspects)."
The food here is so good and service is great too
Very clean. Friendly staff. Manager was extremely friendly. This is a well run restaurant.
General Manager and store staff were great!
I love Boston Market but there is no where to input my gift card in ‚Äòselect payment options‚Äô. Please fix !
I get notified of a special offer but cannot find it on the app!!
I can‚Äôt be the only person who has never placed a to-go order. Why can‚Äôt you have the option to scan your dine-in receipt and earn points?
Had to pay by credit card if not order using the app won‚Äôt work.
I always love the spinach and squash with dark meat. üòç
Tried 5 times in a row but the app just crashes every single time I open the cart after making an order. Useless.
First I only had one request noted in order: well done & dark chicken on outside. Chicken I received was super light & bloody. Then I ordered curbside pickup. Parked in designated curbside pickup parking spot. Only for staff member to tell me they don‚Äôt bring food to cars. Ummmmm ok.
App seems fine; store is a disaster.
"Tried twice to use the app, both times it crashed 1/2 way through the order. I was so annoyed I gave up, then decided to leave this review.."
Every time I try to order it says ‚Äúunknown request error. Try again later‚Äù
You pay more to order on-line than you would if you ordered in the store. Not worth it. Don‚Äôt use this app.
"I can‚Äôt order curbside it doesn‚Äôt take my vehicle info, also fried chicken not on online menu"
"It makes me hungry for rotisserie chicken! The perfect bite is a little rotisserie chicken, gravy, and cornbread."
Had to go back 3 times because the order was incorrect. No ownership was taking just pointing fingers and it‚Äôs not like they were super busy cause no one was in there.
Can‚Äôt place an order with this app. Full of glitches.
There is absolutely no reason for a food app to require a tougher password than my banking app. Jesus Christ 8 characters one Upper one Lower one number and one special character???? I‚Äôm ordering chicken not a missile strike!
Love the App.  Very user friendly.  Great Rewards too!
Easy to use it
We think the food and app are very good!
Can‚Äôt even check out. Says my total doesn‚Äôt match the amount on my payment method.
The manager and employees told me that they don't assemble the order until you go in. Might as well order it inside. No time saved.
"I can‚Äôt login in the app. However, I am able to login at their website. 

This app stinks"
Fast and easy to use!
Nice deals great value
I spent like $30 and points still not going to my account
"App does not work. Cannot order, very buggy and does not apply rewards. Also the pricing is flat out wrong."
Installing latest version cleared my credentials and selecting Forgot Password does nothing - just a blank page. Doesn‚Äôt anyone QA their work anymore???
"App keeps asking for vehicle details. Thus, I can‚Äôt complete an order. The store only allows curbside right now LOL."
"The font is too small to be useful. 
The navigation is very confusing. 
The selection menus don‚Äôt make sense, and after that there are no options but to quit. 
No real online ordering. 
No concise location mapping. 
But the worst thing of all is the teeny tiny font. It‚Äôs truly a horrible experience."
Excellent home cooked meal to fuel evening dinner!
Delicious food great service.! Great store!
"Unless, can‚Äôt order online anymore due to cornbread error‚Ä¶"
"Since when has KFC had an app?! I feel the need to hop in my cream/tan (it's like the color of a perfectly toasted marshmallow) jeep and get a chicken sandwich and some coleslaw. The app is so clean and so... so... desirable! 
Could it have a kids menu? Yes. Could it give me the option to remove ice from my drink? Yes. Could the developer make it a little more personalized? Like a 'good morning, I hope you get that promotion today' (bc I know the internet knows all my info anyways üôÑ).. yes 
But overall, I give the app 5 stars in general. But for the sake of specificity, I give it 4.765 stars. 
You all should be proud of yourselves, mucho props (it was about time) and my 2021 has definitely gotten better from the discovery of this app and all that is has to offer 
It's even better than Barack Obama eating pineapple on his pizza... I said what I said ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
The app desperately needs work. It‚Äôs missing a lot of menu items. I had assumed they were removed from the menu so ordered different then a then what I actually wanted. So when I got there I seen the actual menu and was disappointed with what I got because everything I wanted was still available. Just not in the app. Also ordered sauces with the app get charged for it. Get up to drive through window they ask did I want any sauces I said no just the ones I ordered with the app. The employees informed me they can‚Äôt actually see what sauces I requested. So if they didn‚Äôt as or I just assumed it was good. I would have paid for sauces and not received them. Disappointing because I act find using apps to order more convenient. Rather then siting at the menu board try to order food and after each item being asked is that all. For real is it so common for people to just say an item and sit silently waiting to be asked if that all. That now it‚Äôs gotten so bad that people can‚Äôt take more then half a second to say the next item before being interrupted with is that all. No I will say and that‚Äôs all at the end of my order thank you very much.
Awful app does not change wait time what so ever I go into kfc EVERY-TIME I end up WAITING AND WAITING AND WAITING either as a customer or a doordasher I get frustrated because as a customer I am going to a fast food place hungry expecting to get my food FAST and I end up waiting 30-45 minutes for a few pieces chicken why would I do that when I can go to any nicer restaurant and dine in and order food and probably wait a shorter amount of time for a whole dine in entree. As a doordasher it‚Äôs beyond frustrating because I am on a roll with good earnings for the day and I am motivated to continue BUT THEN I go to Kfc and everything changes I end up losing my whole momentum just because I decided to accept a doordash order from kfc I end up waiting over 30 minutes!!! Keep in mind in that time I‚Äôve just been waiting I don‚Äôt get paid I get a bad review instead for taking too long because kfc doesn‚Äôt have any chicken ready but somehow it‚Äôs my fault and I can never explain it because it‚Äôs no contact delivery
"Placing the order took a little while to figure out but now that I‚Äôve done it, it should be easy from now on.  I would recommend ordering from it.  There are promotional items ordering digitally that you won‚Äôt see at the store.  I was gifted a free order of large fries.  Other deals are also featured that are not offered except on the App. Plus, the order was ready for pickup when I arrived at the store."
"I ordered and fully paid for my food through the KFC app , only to be told when I arrived at the location that: 1) they didn‚Äôt have most of what I ordered on hand, and 2) I would have to call KFC‚Äôs 800 number to cancel the order and get a refund, as the local store has no way of doing that.

So this app basically takes your payment upfront and then messages your order to the local store with no way of the store confirming that they can actually provide what you want at the time you requested. And then you find out after you‚Äôve driven to the restaurant whether or not you will actually get your food, AND whether or not you will have to (like me) sit on hold for 15 minutes to request a refund from their customer service department.
Picking up the phone and calling in your order to the local KFC would give you instant feedback on whether you can get what you want, without paying for food you can‚Äôt get upfront.
Do not waste time on this app."
"I've tried to use this app to order food on three separate occasions, but I've given up and gone in myself every single time. Several options from the menu are missing, including drinks: no root beer, no Dr. Pepper (it's actually available for selection all the way up until I choose my location), etc. even though you can order them all if you go there in-person. This issue seems to extend to the website as well. The meal options that they do offer give you no room for customization. If a meal comes with a medium drink and you want to upgrade to a large, too bad. The only way around it is to order every piece individually, which will cost significantly more than if you bought it as a meal. If there actually is a way to make changes, then it is incredibly well hidden and unintuitive compared to every other fast food app that I've used before."
"First of all, KFC needs to learn a lesson it still hasn‚Äôt learned in decades of evolving fast food competition. Mainly being make things easier, cheaper and more accurate for your customer along with tasty food. KFC has mostly had tasty food. The prices for what you get are high for the most part due to lack of easily obtained deals in this app. Heck, I JUST saw an ad for a 3.99 chicken sandwich on TV and the deal isn‚Äôt even in the app???!!! There are literally NO app deals in the app whereas Wendy‚Äôs, McDonalds, Subway, Taco Bell etc ALL have app deal exclusives and some type of loyalty reward digital coupons. Apps should ALWAYS have the best deals. It‚Äôs the point of downloading them and gobbling up data and the time in using them. Loyalty rewards etc tied to the app as well. Come on KFC stop giving us reasons to go to Popeyes or Church‚Äôs instead."
"I‚Äôm only giving this app 2 ‚≠êÔ∏è because of the staff being friendly and quick to offer assistance. I made an order to the location closest to my house and it sent me somewhere else. Not only that, this location I was sent to didn‚Äôt have my order!!! It‚Äôs going on 2hrs since I created the order and I‚Äôm still waiting!! I love KFC, but something needs to be done to correct this location issue. 

I created a dummy order to see where it would send me... I had to select my location TWICE to get it to stick that I wanted this particular location. All I can say is it‚Äôs going to be a while before I use this app again."
Horrible app!!! It took my money but did not place my order. üò° it gave me an error message BUT STILL TOOK MY MONEY!! I go up to the kfc and they didn‚Äôt have the order request either. I went ahead and paid for food because I was starving and it wasn‚Äôt the managers fault the app is trash. She couldn‚Äôt refund me because there was nothing for her to refund‚Ä¶ I tried to look up my order history but all I get is the loading circle. I sent an email and tried to call corporate but have gotten no where. Sure it‚Äôs less than $7 but that‚Äôs not the point. I recommend you just go to the store and order there. I had my food in less than 5 minutes when I ordered in store.
"I tried ordering with the app the other day and it said there was a problem with my card. Figuring it was a glitch, I retried the transaction, no dice. I tried reentering the card information and ordered one more time. Received a message saying that my card information was bad. In the app I received notifications that my orders had been cancelled. I then go to look at my card and find I‚Äôve been charged 3 times for the orders placed. To make matters worse, I tried emailing the email address provided in the app and it bounced back as an invalid email address. Hoping I‚Äôll get my money back on those orders I never received. Been days at this point, fingers crossed."
"Having previously downloaded the app and setting up an account, I decided to order‚Ä¶
An hour and a half later I still had no food!!! 
Every time I clicked on the ‚Äúorder status‚Äù link the page failed to load. I then cancelled the order and notified customer service through the app. Knowing this is a fairly new app I was willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. However it‚Äôs been almost a month since and all I have received from them by way of explanation is the auto generated response.
Just terrible customer service not how things should go for a new highly promoted app."
"Seriously, I ordered using the app, arrived and went through the drive through to pick it up at the time it was supposed to be ready, but was told I needed to come inside to pick it up. There was no one behind me in the drive through. I could have driven up, ordered, (got the drink I really wanted which wasn‚Äôt on the app menu) and sat in my car after being up and working a 12+ hour day. I‚Äôll know better next time‚Ä¶"
"They made me order through app cos I get to
Pick up ny food quickly uaing Mobile Order Pickup. When I went there, these losers locked themselves inside not reaponding to me for 20 mins. I waited in Chicago cold for 20 mins and my hands are frozen to a point where I couldnt feel a think. I had to go back into drive through queue for 35 mins again and get my order delivered cold. They not only made me waste my time ordering agead, they also delivered cold food and made me freeze. Now I will make them cold enough with my lawsuit and make them taste what happens when they freeze a lawyer almost to death."
"This app is awful. I ordered food last Thursday, went to the store to pick up my order, only to be told that what I had ordered was no longer available and they told me they couldn‚Äôt refund me my money at the store and that I‚Äôd have to go through the app. There‚Äôs no option on the app to cancel your order. I‚Äôve since opened a ticket online and have not heard back from anybody or gotten a refund. There‚Äôs a 1-800 number the store employees told me to call but I‚Äôve held for 20-30 minutes and never get to talk to a person. What a terrible experience."
"I‚Äôve had this app for what feels like forever and no matter how long I want, how many times I try, no matter how many times I install and uninstall the app, or turn my phone off and on it NEVER works! Every time I go to order it says no results. It doesn‚Äôt matter what location I pick it ALWAYS says no results and won‚Äôt let me pick a location. Even when I go to different cities and one time I even went to a different state and still nothing. At this point it‚Äôs just taking up space on my phone. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it to anyone."
"Not only did it not save my future pick up time for a later time, told me after submitting would be ready in 3-5 minutes, we live 20 away. Called KFC and they wouldn‚Äôt remake or hold, just tossed it on the warmer table. Also - if I use the app, I cannot pick up in the drive thru, you have to go in which I find ridiculous. Everything is paid for, one of the quickest orders and your gonna make me park and walk in for you to just hand me a bag?!? Deleted app, just stupid."
"This app will allow you to order items that are not sold at the location. I ordered wings on the app and drove 15 minutes to pick them up. The drive thru informed me they do not carry wings at their location and I will have to refund with whatever service I ordered them on. 
This app does not have a button for cancellation or order issues, the only way to contact them is through ‚Äúfeedback‚Äù on there website which is typically used to review your experience.
Please fix these problems. Big waste of time."
"When you order thru the app, there is no communication on your order when the store has issues. 
I ordered thru the app in advance specifically to avoid a line. 
However when I arrived the store lobby was closed due to staffing issues. 
I had to wait thru the drive thru line, then only to find out they were out of extra crispy chicken and could not satisfy my order. 
My option was to take original recipe, or go thru the app to try and get a refund‚Ä¶ after already waiting thru the line. 
I understand running out of product. 
I understand being short staffed. 
Turn off the online order option thru the store to alleviate issues like this. 
I would not be as upset had I just arrived at the store and experienced these issues. 
I am upset because the app offers a service it cannot in good faith fulfill."
"How do you finally build an app after being a decade late and manage to not even add your entire menu to it? Like just the main thing to point out, you don‚Äôt have popcorn tenders/chicken in your app menu. I have not been able to even order through the app yet because there are missing menu items or things are only bundled in a specific way on the app and you can choose what you‚Äôd like. Seriously your parent company is PepsiCo, you have the money to do better‚Ä¶"
"Still no refund since 3/8/21; sent in my order number and nothing. Beware!!!!

I ordered via this app, got to the store and discovered they were out of both items. No one watched out to me until I got there. Tried to cancel so I could get a refund. No cancellation choice. Had to call the customer service #, was told credit may take 2-3 days depending upon my bank; a week has gone by and still no refund. Please do not use this app. You will never get your money back."
"This app does everything I need it to for my chicken cravings. I‚Äôve only had a few issues here and there, but nothing I couldn‚Äôt figure out and work through."
"Went to kfc today.  Hadn‚Äôt been for a couple years.  Had to pull forward to wait in fries.  Husband said his fries were fresh and hot and his sandwich was warm enough.  I ordered the chicken strips and fries.  Chicken strips were somewhat warm.  Fries were cold.  Room temperature at best.  I tasted one.  I don‚Äôt understand.  If a customer has to pull forward for 5 or so minutes to wait on fries to cook, why would staff not give fresh fries with all of the meals?  Disappointed to say the least."
I like being able to order ahead and save time but I can‚Äôt customize which chicken pieces go in the bucket.  My wife doesn‚Äôt like the wings and prefers to switch them out for breast pieces.  Since we can‚Äôt request that we have to go to the store and order and wait.
It‚Äôs sad how this is the way I have to look for ways to order my Dinner at kfc. They don‚Äôt know what that means at the restaurants. They always want to sell you a combo with a drink. I don‚Äôt need the drink. At all. So frustrating. The app lets you see options they don‚Äôt even know about at the location.
There‚Äôs a kfc right down my road but instead it tells me I can only go to the one 11 miles away?? If you can only use this at certain locations it shouldn‚Äôt be an app. This is not a problem at any other fast food chain that offers a mobile app. Not to mention why can‚Äôt I scan for points? I download all the food apps just to scan for points when I occasionally get food there. Clearly the kfc app is just as outdated as their stores.
The app will allow you to order from a store that is closed. Then charge you and force you to speak with multiple agents in order to refund the order for a product they did not provide. There is listed to be an option to cancel an order that isn‚Äôt made yet but this is false. Over an hour of my time on the phone waiting to have you return my funds without even an apology.
"The app works pretty well. I placed order, pulled into one of several designated curbside spots, followed all instructions. I could‚Äôve sat there till midnight, and they would never have brought out my food. Apparently they don‚Äôt check their alerts! Employees weren‚Äôt busy at all. Why have designated curbside parking spots if you have to go inside????"
App is very hard to use to order. Some of the selections don‚Äôt work. Tried ordering a chicken sandwich. Said there were 2 to choose from. Couldn‚Äôt choose. Just had to add to the bag and hope we got what we wanted. This happened on all choices. Was unable to see the the size of cole slaw. It was easier to wait in a long line and order at the drive thru.
Downloaded this because of an advertisement for ‚Äúfree delivery‚Äù when ordering via the app. When I try to use this garbage it just sends me to DoorDash (complete with their usual delivery fee). What is the point of an app that does nothing except send you to another app? Why not just say ‚Äúuse DoorDash‚Äù instead? This is a COMPLETELY useless app designed to steal your data while offering literally nothing. Save yourself the annoyance and skip this one.
"First, the app is fine. It‚Äôs a little clunky, but manageable. KFC managed to remove all of the convenience from a mobile app.  The problem is that unlike every other fast food place, when you order via the app, you can‚Äôt pick it up in the drive through. You either have to park and call a phone number for it to be brought out to you, or you have to park and go inside to get it."
"KFC is certainly tasty but it also is expensive so I usually use a coupon for a bit if savings. I liked the idea of being able to order ahead, however I discovered this app does have a provision to enter a coupon so everything purchased through the app is full price. They should add coupons to the app so same price is available for online as for walk-in."
"The app does not notify you when a menu item is out of stock and yet it still charges you. I placed an order and the restaurant told me that they did not have any pot pies, but there was no way for me to cancel the order to avoid being charged for out-of-stock items! So I was still charged for the order even though the restaurant didn‚Äôt have all of the items I wanted. And I couldn‚Äôt cancel! Fix your app KFC!"
"KFC How are you not gonna have a deals tab on your app?  The $5 deal is nowhere to be found on the app, none of the cheaper meals are listed.  We‚Äôre getting the app and selling our data souls for some points and a free chicken leg every 6 months once we accumulate enough points to earn it.  Let us get the cheap meals too.  Please tell me I‚Äôm dumb and missed it"
Used app. Charged the card. After long wait when I got to the speaker they only had part of the order. Didn‚Äôt have time to call people that I was picking up for to see what else. Tried to call customer service to refund card only to not get anyone on the line ( big surprise). Will never use app again. Cash only from now on in case they fail to deliver.
"This app is a mess. It took forever to get the payment part to come up so I could populate it; then the ‚Äúplace order‚Äù bar never became active. Get it right, or take it down, guys! This is a simple app and the difficulties with it are frustrating in the extreme. Now I have to watch my payment card to ensure I wasn‚Äôt charged despite never being able to click that place order bar."
"Don‚Äôt bother wasting your time on this. KFC just wants to push deliveries and not improve customer experience as always.   We cannot order unsweetened tea or half cut tea. Cannot request all legs instead of leg and thigh. Cannot tell them not to bother with the cookies as no one likes them in our home. As others have said, it doesn‚Äôt decrease the wait time. Perhaps KFC needs to take lessons from Chik-Fil-A"
"Downloaded the app just to order online. Place my order and less than a minute later they call me on the phone to say they‚Äôre out of chicken and have been for several hours. 
Why, on the app, doesn‚Äôt it say, ‚Äúout of stock‚Äù or some other notification? Why am I now responsible to call corporate to cancel my order? She can‚Äôt just cancel it? There are so many head scratchers here."
"Downloaded specifically so I could order and pay ahead. Tender buckets are nowhere to be found. Grateful I didn‚Äôt actually order after I read other reviews stating missing menu items, inability to pay using Apple Pay, and in at least one case, someone ordering and the store not able to fulfill the order or help with a refund. What is the point of this app?!"
"I down loaded the app and set up the account. Placed an order only to be told it was canceled, not once but twice. I have now decided to never use or eat KFC again and this is due to when I went to the location they would not honor my order stating that is only an online thing. I showed them the 2 cancelations and they were like oh well. This company has gone down hill withe there service."
"I tried to order a Beyond nugget combo on the app like I usually do but for some reason the app does not list Beyond meat any more. I then visited the restaurant in-person and when I ask for the Beyond nuggets, they had no problem preparing that for me. 

So in summary, the app is not showing menu items that are available in the restaurant if you go in person. Terrible‚Ä¶"
Introduce KFC Rewards a rewards program to earn points to redeem for free stuff at KFC like chicken and sides points can be earned  for ordering in restaurant or online or in app can also redeem points as well
I have to say the food was done before I arrived so it was easy for me to pick up but when I got home food was missing from the bag. That makes it terrible on me because now I have to go back to pick up the food that I didn‚Äôt yet.
"Placed an order on the app and picked up in drive-thru with no problems. The app doesn‚Äôt have the chicken tenders in their menu options, though. Just popcorn chicken. It would be nice to be able to order from the complete menu."
Don‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs only original recipe. We can‚Äôt choose extra crispy?
Glad to see KFC finally has their own app. I‚Äôve used it a few times now and the experience has been great.
"Terrible experience with my first order. Half the order was missing on arrival, driver refused to help, called restaurant and nobody picked up the phone. Assistance from app is non existent, they go out of their way to make it difficult to contact them. This is a total scam operation. I have never left a review before but I am truly upset. Deleting the app right now."
Nearly impossible to use almost acts like some junior level scam app. Check the apps by the other YUM Brands like Pizza Hut and Taco Bell guys. Update just couldn‚Äôt justify keeping just not functional needs a lot of work. May check back when you guys have time to work the many bugs out of it.
"It would not allow me to make an account so I used a browser to make one and it still would not allow me to sign into the account so in my experience this app was a waste of time, there was an option to continue as a guest but there are no exclusive deals when I tried that so I gave up and deleted the app"
"Just got the app, signed up, and tried to pick a store, but when I select Houston, Texas, where I‚Äôm at, it says no results. Pretty sure I‚Äôve eaten KFC here for ugh, at least 30 years."
"I love the UI/UX, just the payment part needs more work. But they finally added the Apple Pay option, which is extremity convenient. So glad that there is finally a KFC app."
"Warning don‚Äôt accidentally add or change your mind about what‚Äôs in your order, because there is no way to remove items. I even tried deleting the app and reinstalling items where still there. Ther is an edit button but using that still doesn‚Äôt allow you to remove or delete items."
I love the ease of using the app and the fact that there is no delivery or extra fees when ordering through the app. Thank you KFC!!
Store service is the worst don‚Äôt listen to the app when it says pull up to drive through and announce your order. Because they will tell you to come in. Second they will substitute your items with things like extra gravy when you paid for more Mac and cheese. Will never get my business again
Went  on the app and paid. App told me it would be ready in a few minutes so I came to pick it up. They didn‚Äôt have the chicken ready or even what I had ordered available at all. Had to wait 10 minutes to get something that I didn‚Äôt even order. Useless app. Better off just going to the store
I love kfc and everything but if y‚Äôall would add a extra option too your pickles and other items I‚Äôd be a happy person :)
The last of the fast-food chains to release an ordering app. Why this took three times longer than the others I‚Äôll never figure out.
This app needs a delete button in case you change your mind on your order.. I even deleted the app to clear my ‚Äúbag‚Äù and it was back in after I reinstalled the app?!?!?!
"The app layout is intuitive and easy to navigate. However there is no option to order drinks without ice which creates waste, since I refill the drinks without ice during pickup."
"I placed my order through the app, order was confirmed, and I was charged, so I went to pick it up, but the store didn‚Äôt have my order, and they said the only way to fix that is to dispute my card charges, it was my first time to use the app and definitely the last because I deleted it."
"The app is totally useless because when you try to pay for anything that‚Äôs in your bag it simply says unexpected error. I tried to use both Apple Pay and manually put in a credit card with the exact same result.

I gave up and went somewhere else, and deleted the app"
Super App! Can‚Äôt believe it was so easy to get the order done so quickly.  I‚Äôm going to use it frequently.
"I don‚Äôt understand why these companies make food app that doesn‚Äôt accept ApplePay, and instead try to force people to store credit card info.  

I‚Äôm not putting my credit card info on every single food/restaurant app, so until this app supports more convenient and safer payment option (ApplePay), I will not be using this app."
At first I didn‚Äôt quite like kfc. However once they came out with the Nashville tenders it makes up for EVERYTHING those are so good.
"App is great and works perfectly! Just needs Apple Pay as a form of payment. Restaurant has it already in drive thru and inside, why not have it in the app?"
"I know you still sell grilled chicken, I called and asked, but your app still only has the option for original or crispy chicken. You‚Äôre losing orders from me on a regular basis just because I can‚Äôt order something halfway healthy that is on your menu, that your app developers forgot about."
"Thank you, thank you, thank you! Just had the new Beyond Chicken and it‚Äôs fantastic!  Please continue this product!

Brenda"
It would be nice to have the option to take out and replaced with other pieces
"There are two locations within 5 miles of my home. I have geolocating turned on in the app but the app shows no stores near my location. 

This is such a basic function for an app and the developer cannot get this basic feature to work."
"Installed the app, chose the store near me, selected the items. But I kept getting the message that said ‚Äòbag is empty‚Äô when I try to pay it. Tried multiple times on different locations and networks (wifi/cellular). Never worked.  Ended up going to the stored and made an order using drvie-thru.  Useless"
"I downloaded the app and immediately found out that I could not change the sides on two different family meal options.  The meal was stuck on coleslaw and mashed potatoes - I wanted neither.  Please change that, then it would be a good app."
I enjoy KFC Beyond Chik‚Äôn and this app doesn‚Äôt allow you to order it. It doesn‚Äôt even come up in the menu items. Just so happens that the KFC I‚Äôm at is only doing online/app orders or drive thru and I in a tractor trailer and can‚Äôt go through the drive thru. So I can‚Äôt order anything. üò°
Waited forever for food and 15 mins to be acknowledged. Put in order at 5:13 it‚Äôs 5:34 still no food.  Have to wait for them to cook chicken.   Like they don‚Äôt know people are gonna get food on their way home from work‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.
"Decided to give the app a try, however probably a once a done with. Placed order and app looked good, as I was pulling into location, app informed me there was a problem and the order was cancelled. Low and behold, I was still charged."
Was going to place an order via app but the drink options in the app are not complete. The option for Sobe Water was not present. Also unable to upgrade drink size.
"Store never got my order, first they thought it was a door dash order. Then they got the order but couldn‚Äôt see it‚Ä¶this was about 35 min after the order was placed. So I told them what it was‚Ä¶and I forgot that I had a mash potato bowl on it, guess that $5.59 was on me, for forgetting I ordered it‚Ä¶.just another failure of KFC."
"Love KFC chicken. There is none better. And that especially goes for the livers. 

 Not all KFC‚Äôs have livers on the menu, (bummer), but I should be able to order livers from the stores that DO serve them. In addition, I noticed KFC‚Äôs website doesn‚Äôt list any livers either. And that‚Äôs just plain un-American."
To make this app more easier to use it would be very helpful to follow current menu items. I‚Äôm not saying the promotional ones but at least the everyday menu items!!!
I‚Äôm sitting in a parking lot at KFC and the app is telling me that no KFC‚Äôs are in my area. So I click on just show me the menu and I cannot get connected to the app. At the same time I can connect to the Internet through other apps and websites without issues.
"I get nonstop ads about this app and the holidays despite the fact the christmas was days ago. the little jingle pisses me off to no end. listen, people who want to buy your food will download the app regardless, theres no need to force it down the publics throat constantly"
"Ordered through the app tonight. App took order and updated me that I should go inside when I get to the restaurant to pick up my order. Except the restaurant was CLOSED. Lights off, doors locked, no one inside or answering the drive thru. Not sure if they stole my money but I sure didn‚Äôt get my order. DONT USE THIS APP"
"I have tried to order green beans on here, but it isn‚Äôt on the app!! Other than that, I love the app!!"
Their famous bowl shows chicken in their bowl on the app but automatically selects the bowl with no chicken and it doesn‚Äôt even tell you when you go to check out. They don‚Äôt even lower the price of the bowl when you take out the entire protein.
"Was excited to order on this app, however there are only a few things listed.  Nothing that we usually order. Please update.  Could not use."
Tried to order bucket meals but you can‚Äôt change your sides.   One of the reasons I love apps is being able to customize easily.   KFC needs to work on that.
"It‚Äôs worked once or twice but it took at least 10 minutes of placing my order over and over and over. Most times, I‚Äôm just stuck in endless loop of mediocrity. Actually, mediocrity would be a huge improvement."
"Useless app which only allows online ordering‚Ä¶you still have to wait in the drive-thru lane 45 minutes because employees won‚Äôt let you in to the store despite what the app says, ‚Äúcome on in!‚Äù Nope, food was very cold after waiting forever in the drive thru."
Totally recommend
Truly one of the lamest fast food apps out there. It‚Äôs quirky to use. It wouldn‚Äôt let me select a store to get pricing. It contains no coupons that I could find. There is virtually no advantage to using this. Just show up in the drive thru and order. The app really isn‚Äôt useful. It shows the company lacks vision.
I live in a large city and very close to a KFC. Would love to order for pick up but the app doesn‚Äôt recognize the store nearest me and says the closest store is over an hour away. Even after typing in the EXACT address of the KFC it still doesn‚Äôt show up.
"No ability to use coupons, no deals, no reward program ...what‚Äôs the purpose of even using this app? There doesn‚Äôt appear to be a benefit to  the user."
You are unable to specify drink size. There is no way to leave a note for the staff like ‚Äúextra napkins‚Äù. The contact phone number keeps deleting itself on the checkout page.
Other restaurants give you more options when you order on the app so it‚Äôs convenient for ordering but with the KFC app I can‚Äôt order a chicken little with extra Mayo only a chicken little with some Mayo or no Mayo so why bother using this over the drive thru window
What we ordered the store was out of.  They called and said that I had to call and cancel the order with corporate instead of them being able to hence the low rating. This costed me time and money just to get the order cancelled.
Order was on time and perfect.  I don‚Äôt see the specials on the window in the app?
Ordered the other night and when I showed up the restaurant was closed (closed 2 hours early for some reason and didn‚Äôt leave a sign) and I couldn‚Äôt cancel my order there‚Äôs no option in the app
"I‚Äôll start using this app once it actually lets you use Apple Pay. I don‚Äôt understand why this isn‚Äôt a thing already, considering that I can use Apple Pay when I order through the Drive-Thru."
It‚Äôs was great we ordered and it took like 5 mins I saved my family 15 mins great app!! üòÑ
Kids menu options not available through app.
"Unlike del taco and popeyes they don‚Äôt give any perks so why even bother with this app. And it freezes .  I just went in person to try their chicken sandwich .. it‚Äôs ok.. bun was mushy and chicken soggy , best part of it was the pickles , it was nice and crisp , and of course the best part is the side of coleslaw."
"Chicken was just OK 
I had a scrawny leg that the Colonel would refuse to eat. 
Sides were good except mashed potato container 1/2 full. 
Larger pieces this time were dry. 
Had better experience with this store in the past."
Thank you for adding Apple Pay!
"It is 6 pm, kfc closes at 9:30. When I try to add anything to bag I just get an endless, ‚Äúplease wait‚Ä¶‚Äù it never gets added. I‚Äôm just going to eat something else now, I give. I guess they really don‚Äôt want to have to give anyone that ‚Äúfree‚Äù chicken sandwich."
"I ordered food from my local KFC in Bryan, Ohio. I am so extremely disappointed. I ordered $26 worth of food and never received my food. Apparently they are closing at 7 pm because of short staffing, and the app didn‚Äôt tell me that, so I lost $26. Is there any way I could get my money back?"
"Spent 20 minutes trying to enter my address only to be met with a pop up that says ‚ÄúPlease provide a valid delivery address.‚Äù I‚Äôm starting to think my apartment doesn‚Äôt actually exist and I‚Äôm just imagining the past 5 years. KFC, care to comment?"
"They finally have an app, but provides absolutely no deals like the others, such as‚Ä¶ Popeyes McDonald‚Äôs etc‚Ä¶ so what was the point?"
"If you had a delivery option within the app, i would fully approve."
"How can a company like PepsiCo allow such a bad app and then location issues when you get there? Come on, PepsiCo, I switched to Pepsi when the other company when woke (Woke-a-Cola). This may not be a priority but it should at least be given some attention!"
Worst experience ever. Set pickup time and order was made 20 minutes before set time. Still forced to wait in drive through after online order which added another 20 minutes. Absolutely worthless.
Thanks for addition of Apple Pay
Will not take my payment. Tried entering my cc and it would error. Tried Apple Pay and it would error. I‚Äôm trying to give you my money and you won‚Äôt take it. This doesn‚Äôt happen to me on any other app. Massive fail.
"Created an order, but app wouldn‚Äôt let me add a credit card in order to complete it. There‚Äôs a place where it says add card but underneath it is just a big grey box which prevented me from adding any info"
.
would love it if the mobile orders can be picked up at the drive thru and select cup size when ordering
"They do not have any of the Monday through Thursday daily deals, only 2/3‚Äôs of the drinks, none of the specials, and their $10 buckets cost $18 on the app. They don‚Äôt have stuff like Nashville hot wings or the country fried steak."
Our local KFC has been here since before I moved here (2002) and your app won‚Äôt show it.  I‚Äôm not going to drive 30 miles away to use the app. I‚Äôm dumbfounded how you have an app that DOESNT show your locations. This is a free-standing KFC. Not in a mall or university.
"Why would they not have certain menu items available on the app?  All they have is chicken, some sides and sandwiches.  That‚Äôs basically it.  Tsk, tsk."
Omg this app is so ridiculous it‚Äôs not funny!!! Whenever you try to select a menu it just slides all over without stopping at your choice. You can‚Äôt even search for what you want. This App needs a serious do over.
The kfc we went to was bad. First there was no chicken theigh at the place we went to. Second the person talk too close to me and her name is sasha. Last she gave us the breast and charged me the same money the address for this kfc is 849  s baldwin Ave and the wait was long.
"We have to use the app to do carry out‚Ä¶ BUT WE CANT ORDER IF THE APP DOESN‚ÄôT WORK. I tried 3 times, gave up and left for Panda Express. I saw another couple doing the same thing, fiddle with their phone, give up and leave same time I did. Then I deleted the app."
I‚Äôm parked in front of KFC trying to place an order and it can‚Äôt find the store.  I‚Äôm driving a one ton DUALLY that doesn‚Äôt fit thru the drive up and the front doors say drive up or mobile only.   We had to leave.
"Easy to use, easy to navigate. Great to order with."
Tried to place an order for 16 pc family and it didn‚Äôt allow me choose all dark.
Can‚Äôt search for items. Could not check out. The final gray button to pay would not respond to tapping.
No deals no promotions no daily discounts just full price no over priced chicken. Jack in the Bix and Burger King rule with there free food and daily low price deals. I‚Äôm going to delete. KFC must be losing so much money from people who love deals. Tbh this app is totally worthless
Ridiculously poor design. Has so few menu choices and our local KFC in Sherman TX that‚Äôs been open for years isn‚Äôt even listed. Deleted in five minutes.
"Two times using this app failed. No chicken dinner two times, despite order confirmation each time. Horrible experience!"
What‚Äôs the point if they don‚Äôt offer deals or coupons?  Mcdonald‚Äôs and Burger King both offer apps with deals and rewards. This is Definitely not worth the space on my Iphone.  DELETED!
Could not find a way on a large order to mix Original and Extra Crispy.
"Wow, what a huge disappointment. It‚Äôs not that much to expect to have the whole menu to choose from. And the whole point of downloading apps is for deals and coupons."
Why even offer the delivery button if I‚Äôm gonna be sent to one of those apps that overcharges by 30 dollars? It‚Äôs unfair. They should‚Äôve kept direct delivery from the app itself rather than this.
Needs Apple Pay for check out. Please.
They made the app so it‚Äôs convenient for them to make the most $$ possible. They don‚Äôt have everything on the app‚Ä¶ might as well go to the restaurant- if you really want it.
"It works, but it keeps freezing my Ipjone 12 mini randomly"
"It was fine until the latest update (which was forced on us). Now it doesn‚Äôt work. At all!  On an iPhone, with the current iOS. It‚Äôs KFC loss. We‚Äôll order elsewhere"
Unable to select dark meat option even though there is a button to select.
Kinda sad when there‚Äôs no option to order stuff that‚Äôs on the menu at the physical location from the app.
"The problem isn‚Äôt the app as much as it is the way it works with the store. 

I used the app to order and when I got home there were several substitutions. 

They did not ask or bother to inform me of what they did. 

Kids at the store said they could not refund me unless I bought through them. Not the app. 

Not worth the trouble. Just use the drive through."
"You can order maybe a total of 20 items including drinks and sides, don‚Äôt know what I expected from a fast food app just now releasing tho."
"Placed an order for 4:15pm
- arrived at the restaurant and checked in
- was told to wait 15 mins 
- waited for 45 minutes until 5pm to get my order!!! 
Why offer a service that you can‚Äôt provide? Zero stars. KFC is terrible.
Not ready for production release, lack of employee training, just truly awful. A total cash grab, not a real service. Deleting app and never coming back, you lost a customer"
I removed this app 5 minutes after loading it!! Tried to set up location and get prices but all it wanted to do is have me order!!
I‚Äôm happy the US finally has a KFC App.
This is the worst app I‚Äôve ever used. Couldn‚Äôt place an order for what I wanted but was able to order what I didn‚Äôt want. No explanation why? Called CS on hold almost as long as had to wait for order.
Don‚Äôt use the app. The app charges you twice; one charge shows up when the transaction is made and the duplicate a couple days later.
"Havnt been to use the app at all yet as the only ones near me are kfc/Taco Bell combos, and they don‚Äôt come up as options in the app? How is that possible when it‚Äôs a kfc restaurant but the Taco Bell app works fine for the same establishments."
"Downloaded the app to try and make an online order, over half of my locations menu isn‚Äôt online. Highly disappointed, why make an app if it‚Äôs halfassed"
"This app never works . No menus,  No ordering, it can‚Äôt even find the location 1 mile away. 
The support pages blames my internet connection. So to test my connection I‚Äôm writing this review"
"Why‚Äôs took so long to get a app!? 
Should been moving faster!"
Why can you not order the $10 large popcorn chicken in the app and can only get it at the store?? ü§îü§îü§î
Simple and intuitive. Love new sandwich!!
"I‚Äôm hungry now! Very effective design, easy to use, visually appealing (I can smell the secret spices)."
"I saw the order is ready to pick up, but when I arrived, I guess they didn‚Äôt even start preparing it yet. I have been waiting outside for 25 mins now, still waiting‚Ä¶"
"I would order, but it won't let me pick a store to see prices first. 
Takes me straight to pickup times!"
Can you pay with cash?
does not improve your wait time you might as well go through the drive through
"Will not allow you to pay cash, only credit card.  I‚Äôm a 100% disabled veteran, in Oklahoma by law I am sales tax exempt.  Their app doesn‚Äôt allow for this. Probably deleting the app."
"I never leave reviews,  it this app real upset me. The app is just downright terrible. Nothing works. Menu DOES NOT SHOW. I can‚Äôt order anything or even look at the menu."
"I saw the release had added Apple Pay, went to place an order and it wasn‚Äôt there üò™"
"Downloaded the app and whenever try to order any items, nothing actually ever gets added in to the Bag to place an order"
It‚Äôs only 2021 KFC you finally got an app for US customers about time ‚Äúslow clap‚Äù. One star because you finally just showed up to the party. Popeyes will always be better.
Can‚Äôt add payment info through the app or web on iPhone. You have to do it through a computer. Need to fix this ASAP.
Enjoyed ordering online
How come the app doesn‚Äôt supply any prices what‚Äôs with that
Food is more expensive on the app than if you order at the restaurant.
What good is an app that doesn‚Äôt include the menu items you want to order?
"I have two KFCs within three miles of me but the app won‚Äôt let me set their location to make a purchase 

Annoying is the best way to describe this ..."
Finally an app that cuts to the chase! No nonsense stalling or timing out! Thanks Colonel Sanders!
Is there going to be free meal for loyalty rewards
Does not load correctly on Iphone 12 or let you chose location.  Take it away!
I downloaded it twice and after you enter all of your info it won‚Äôt let you make a purchase!
"Forced to re-enter payment data repeatedly. After all that, still wouldn‚Äôt complete purchase. Waste of time."
"No deals, not all menu items. They don‚Äôt even have all the beverages that they offer. What a complete waste. App is so bad it deterred me from their restaurant."
Can‚Äôt order a chicken tender bucket combo. It‚Äôs on the menu at my local store. I know because we get this all the time.  Uninstalled app from my phone. So much for convenience.
"Attempted KFC because it‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve had it. The app doesn‚Äôt have our local restaurant, there aren‚Äôt prices, and the navigation is confusing."
The app took my payment and notified that my order was completed. I drove to the location and it was closed. I lost my money due to this app.
This app is so disappointing.   It rarely works and my stores either don‚Äôt or can‚Äôt use it when it does.
"Ok so back in October me and my parents got KFC for there anniversary and I was not happy with the food. The chicken was cold, the biscuit was way too dry and I ordered a cookie and they forgot it. Not a great experience, do not recommend"
When I opened it up and typed in my address (I tried everything even the exact cords) it said wrong address
Can‚Äôt add payment info without first picking a location. Can‚Äôt find a location that is 1 mile away.
Menu is blank. Can‚Äôt order. App is completely non-functional.
You still have to go inside and wait for them to make it ..It‚Äôs a joke....useless
They don‚Äôt offer mixed buckets on the app
I have kfc here in Durant ok didn‚Äôt show up disappointed every fast food in town has one do better kfc
The app doesn‚Äôt even load anything. When I try to choose a store it says no results as if I‚Äôm trippin & there‚Äôs really no KFC‚Äôs in NYC. Smttt get it together ppl !
The app works as logically as the store does. Perfect fit. Hard to navigate through. People should hire Chick-fil-A for everything then put their own label on it.
Pay wouldn‚Äôt work
Literally nothing in the app works. Can‚Äôt see menu. Can‚Äôt order. Can‚Äôt find a store. Terrible.
App doesn‚Äôt work but neither does the KFC website ordering. It‚Äôs like they don‚Äôt want you to order food.
"Website is slower than using old school dial up, may still be using dial up servers. App was worse!"
"Been there five times, messed up on my order four times but the food is good"
"If you get to the store and they say they‚Äôre not accepting online orders, good luck getting a refund. Customer service is horrible!"
Trying to order and it won‚Äôt let you add to cart! How frustrating!!!
Can not locate a kfc down the street from so now I have to go and order it thru drive thru thanks
Give us vegan options not someone dead body
Cannot delete my order if I change my mind in bag section! Junk!
"Every time I try to load the app, it just shuts down."
I downloaded because the app description said exclusive deals. There are no deals. I won‚Äôt call you colonel after that. Goodbye.
"App doesn‚Äôt offer tenders or option for rotisserie chicken, nor does it contain all sides options. Worthless!"
"I'm not talking about the food, the food is good, i mean the menu with the sliding selections as you scroll."
It‚Äôs impressing how KFC managed such a terrible with today‚Äôs technology
Placed order and no one could find it. Ended up waiting in store 30 minutes. Very rude staff.
"I have been using this app for over a year and I like it a lot. I‚Äôm giving it 4 stars only because the coupons could be better and being a member could get you more coupons, but they give you only 3 good coupons for the month and that‚Äôs all. I would like to see better coupons and more of them, especially since you have some very loyal customers! That‚Äôs just me though and only my opinion."
"I do not have a plastic B-R card so having the T-Mobile offer was an opportunity to download the App and create a virtual card since it may be the end of April, but it‚Äôs still too cold for ice cream and the promo value will expire shortly if not transferred to a gift card. I much prefer a virtual card.
This App is not at all intuitive when trying to apply the T-Mobile promo to a new virtual card. I eventually got it to work after several attempts and apologies from the App about the App not being able to add the promo at that time. I did it a few days ago and may have gone through the website since the App was being difficult.
Now I have a second T-Mobile promo I wanted to add to my existing virtual card and that feature is not possible as a reload at this time. I tried creating an additional virtual card and that is also not possible at this time according to the App which says I can do it online or in the store.
If the T-Mobile offer was going to exacerbate an already disfunction App you are only further embarrassing B-R and T-Mobile before the App could accommodate the T-Mobile offer.
I will try the website again but whether I succeed or fail that doesn‚Äôt change my opinion of the App."
"I did the whole 9 yards-the app, my info, took forever to even maneuver it‚Ä¶
sent my best friend not one but TWO gift cards-of course, my $ pulled from my bank right away. I know my bf‚Äôs info by heart. Her email has NEVER changed-she NEVER got either card. Have YRIED to get through to someone for a solution but to no avail. I‚Äôm a disabled veteran with hands/fingers that barely work‚Ä¶only stating this because I spent SOOO much time filling out every little thing B-R‚Äôs asked for and got NOTHING for ALL that time & trouble!!  Someone somewhere got paid w/ my $!! 
Waist of my time!
(Salt in the wound-just recently one of our only 2 stores just folded up & went away. Now we have one. Only ONE-and to bring my business to them-it‚Äôs a 40 minute drive 1-way. LOVE the couple that runs it but considering most all of us take the time to download an app to be able to get some kind of a coupon or treat from time to time and ice cream prices have gone up like everything else‚Ä¶just a sad deal. 
Sheryl"
"I love Baskin Robbins but this app is probably the worst restaurant/store app I‚Äôve ever used. It crashed while I was making an account and now my birthday is wrong and there‚Äôs no way to fix it. I went in today to use a coupon offered in the app, only to find there was a timer once activated. It said ‚Äú5:00‚Äù and I assumed that must mean 5 hours, but actually it was 5 minutes! By the time it was my turn it coupon was gone. Fortunately the store has excellent customer service and honored the coupon anyway even though I didn‚Äôt even ask for them to since it was my mistake for ‚Äúactivating‚Äù the coupon too early. This timer for coupons is completely ridiculous and I can‚Äôt see any benefit to the customer or the stores for having such an aggravating feature. I am deleting this app, and encourage others to avoid this app altogether."
"I‚Äôve had this app for a while and have used it to order cakes for family events a few times. It was great, because I could put the information in and it just worked, and that‚Äôs all I wanted. 

But since the latest app update, I can‚Äôt check out. I enter all my credit card information (which, by the way, why can‚Äôt a major company like this use Apple Pay so that I don‚Äôt have to manually type my credit card?! It is 2021!) and all my contact information, and the ‚Äúcomplete order‚Äù button at the bottom just doesn‚Äôt do anything. No errors, I‚Äôm not missing any fields - it‚Äôs just like the button isn‚Äôt there at all. 

Yikes. If your app is literally preventing people from buying your products, it may be time for a do-over."
"I love Baskin Robbins but this app is horrible. Probably the worst food app I‚Äôve ever used. Really counterintuitive. I tried to order a cake through it and even though the cake was $45 and it was the only thing in the cart, it said the grand total was $180?!! So I call the store to order. When I go to pick it up, I try to redeem the $5 off coupon I have and right when I click the coupon it says ‚Äúunhandled exception occurred‚Äù and then the reward disappeared. The lousy thing is the store wouldn‚Äôt even honor the discount after I told them about the issue. I mean I know they aren‚Äôt the ones responsible for the app but it‚Äôs just bad business all around. Nice trick on pretending I‚Äôll get a discount when I won‚Äôt."
"I have been unsuccessful In trying to order a cake for my son‚Äôs birthday in a few days.  I get all the way through picking out the design, cake variety, ice cream flavor and message, but when I actually go try to checkout, I get an error message‚Äî‚ÄúError: Looks like we‚Äôre frozen.‚Äù  It‚Äôs very annoying.  I‚Äôve tried logging out then logging back in, restarting my phone, uninstalling and reinstalling the app, but I get the same result every single time.  In going back through all the app reviews here, it seems like the same problems were there from years ago and nothing was fixed.  I guess Baskin & Robbins just doesn‚Äôt care that they have a craptastic app."
"I don‚Äôt even know where to start. I‚Äôve tried to order a few different cakes through this app. I ended up having to go in to the store to do it because the apps wouldn‚Äôt accept payment. The app was slow and awkward for ordering. 

Also, I get notifications that there are new coupons on the app. Coupons. Their word. Not mine. I have never gotten a coupon nor have I gotten a deal under their deals. I exclusively get promotions. Try one of this drink or this new flavor or we have cakes for graduation. Those are not coupons. Those are not deals. 

DQ has a great app. Their ice cream may not be as good as BR but the app is worth having. It‚Äôs time to for me to delete the BR app."
"Baskin Robbins is an amazing company to me and I love it always. What would make me a much better, and happier, is if their digital options to purchase didn‚Äôt only come from Door Dash. I‚Äôve been hoping, and waiting patiently for the app to update properly to make it so I can order online ice cream and cakes but I haven‚Äôt been lucky. While I can buy some flavors in Fred Meyer, I want to support this franchise directly because my favorite flavor is actually ‚ÄúDaiquiri Ice‚Äù & ‚ÄúChocolate Chip Cookie Dough‚Äù. 
I also tried ordering on the website thinking ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no way this doesn‚Äôt work‚Äù and I was wrong. Please fix both of them so that we can all enjoy what we grew up on. I would love to see you guys thrive into the future."
"After wasting 20+mins on its website and its app (cuz the website didn‚Äôt work so I tried to download its app as well), the checkout process still couldn‚Äôt complete but showing me the same error message which I do not know what went wrong. After four attempts I‚Äôm totally fed up and will order with some other shop after I leave this review. In addition, they are asking way too much personal info for ordering a cake, you are required to leave your address and phone number and email no matter what (sign in as guest or sign up or pick up only)."
"Surely a business like this can manage to create the option for its app users to merge the gift cards they receive. I find it a bit ridiculous having to e-mail customer service to complete an otherwise simple task. It‚Äôs also a hassle to use the separate gift cards off the mobile app in store...slows down the progression of the line and makes for uncomfortable exchanges. Otherwise, a decent app. New flavors and promotions are always up to date and the notifications are sound."
"When a business offers a perk BASED on the condition that you get their app, my experience is that most deliver on their promises. Not this one. After over a week of it not working, I went to my local BR & showed them & asked them to help. The bottom line is that they had no solution & didn‚Äôt seem to care. As I was about to order my sundae (anyway), I felt a sense of having been duped. Instead, I said I had to go & give this app 0 stars- which I WISH was an option. If you want the app to facilitate buying more Baskin Robbins products, get it. If you want it for the perks or promises, good luck."
This app used to be great when it worked. And being that there must be some sort of partnership with the app developers who do the Dunkin‚Äô app I put the blame on them for all the issues logging in to the apps. Until they can resolve this error communicating with server issues I will not be going to either Baskin Robbins or Dunkin if I can‚Äôt access the coupons and gift card balances I have with them.
"What is the point of this app even existing if you can‚Äôt actually mobile order a cone, a milkshake or a sundae on it? You can only buy cakes and quarts of ice cream. Then you get in the drive-thru and have to wait too long to put in your order, even though there‚Äôs only one other car in line. Then you tell them what you want and you have to repeat it because they didn‚Äôt hear you say it the first time. üôÑü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Epic FAIL. Plus the app isn‚Äôt very intuitive or user friendly, it‚Äôs a bit stiff. Whoever designed this needs to be fired from the UI/UX team ASAP!!!!!!! üëèüèªüëèüèªüòÇ"
"I wanted to buy a birthday cake for my father, but the app won‚Äôt let me complete the checkout. It keeps freezing, and I‚Äôve tried repeatedly to get it to work only to be met with the ‚ÄúSorry looks like we‚Äôre frozen!‚Äù notification. There‚Äôs way too many loading errors on the app in general. The layout for the app is just clunky, there‚Äôs no search bar so you have to scroll through all their cakes in order to find the one you‚Äôre looking for. I just wanted to buy a birthday cake but man....this app makes it impossible"
"I could do everything fine on the app but I got a bunch of T-Mobile Tuesdays offers which are only $2 each, and there‚Äôs no way to combine the offers. Also, it truly bugs me that I can‚Äôt use them online and I couldn‚Äôt sign into my account online to order a cake for my sisters birthday. I had to get myself to the store, choose one of the few cakes they had, and then use the gift cards one at a time. The poor people behind me had to wait about 15 minutes, and I had to give my phone to the cashier many separate times. It was embarrassing and utterly unacceptable."
"This app is terrible. It won‚Äôt let me log in at all. I‚Äôve already tried deleting and re-downloading the app and changing my password. And Baskin-Robbins prompted me to log into their website and I go to the website and it says I can only log in on the app... which the app won‚Äôt allow me to do. The coupon timer is ridiculous and the stupidest thing I‚Äôve ever experienced. Also some Baskin Robbins locations DO NOT HONOR THE COUPONS! When the app was somewhat working, every time I clicked it, it had logged me out again. Guys there‚Äôs a reason this app has 2 stars..."
"I decided to splurge on a budget to treat my daughter to ice cream since I had a coupon. We got 2 double scoops on 1-waffle cone & other in a waffle bowl). Using the coupon under deals in the app (buy one cone, get one 50% off). I was expecting to get 50% off one cone making the $5.29/2= $2.65 off to pay less.  The coupon only took off $1.78 (not sure where that amount came fromüò†). The deals on the 31st is no longer; therefore, I expect the coupon be more of a deal.  In this pandemic people can use more of a discount.  I felt cheated."
"i used to be able to open app and be automatically logged in & my coupons pulled up, but since the update, i open app and it tells me to log in, which i do through FB, but instead of logging me in, it takes me to a screen that says sign up and when i check that i'm 13 or over, it says account already exists...well duuuuh, log me in though FB then, like i always have. Another thing is the B'day club. why ask for my b'day if its going to change the date by 2 or 3 days? Someone PLEASE GET IT TOGETHER. What is yalls issue?"
"This app is completely USELESS!!! You can‚Äôt really order anything! I wanted to order a cappuccino blast and a banana split, but guess what?  You can‚Äôt order it!! What‚Äôs the point of having an app if you can only order pre-packed ice cream and brownies.  So.... let me get this straight, this app lets you order things you can go to the store and pick up, but stuff that takes time to make you still have to go in order and wait?  What‚Äôs the point then?  Whoever created this app must have been a genius!! Congrats to them!"
So I‚Äôm writing this review hoping that the app could have a merge balance option when you have multiple cards. I had a few cards with $2 in them each and merging them would make paying easier rather than opening each one separately.
"I love Baskin Robins. I use my TMobile gift cards all the time when I get them. There‚Äôs only one option I would add. Combine gift cards instead of having to switch through a bunch of gift cards. It would help a lot. 

The app works really well for me. No problems and everything is easy to access."
"This app is just disrespectful. I feel like BR hired a bunch of first year programming students to make this app. Nothing works. I‚Äôm always looking at a ‚Äúloading‚Äù screen. App crashes all the time. It‚Äôs not worth the hassle to do anything on this card. It makes me not want to visit BR. I don‚Äôt understand how because the Dunkin Donuts app is phenomenal. If I didn‚Äôt know it before, today I am convinced Baskin Robbins is a failing company with no value over other ice cream shops. What a joke. Go to a local place instead. I‚Äôll bet their ‚Äúreward system‚Äù is better anyways"
"I downloaded this app around Father‚Äôs Day and tried to purchase a gift card for my dad. I was charged 5 times for one gift card cuz the app said there was an error message several times I tried to complete the order. Then after several attempts of reaching out to customer service I still have yet to get the money that was over charged back. :/ Bummed I don‚Äôt have something better to say about this app, but very disappointed with my experience."
I love going to Basking Robbins but i hate this app. I have gift cards on the app but every time i go in store to try and use them they struggle and they apologize and tell me I can‚Äôt use it. Not only that but i also can‚Äôt merge them so when i was able to use them and it was once i had to individually scan each gift card. This app is such a let down for a growing ice cream shop. If you‚Äôre going to give me the option to pay from on my phone you need to make sure it works.
"Not only does this app frustrate you just trying to make an account to log in, which by the way you can‚Äôt, you are forced to use Facebook to log in... but even once you are in and want to pay, it asks you for a log in again, and there is no way around this one. It‚Äôs just a constant loop of asking for a log in name and password.

USELESS APP by a large company like Baskin Robbins. If I could give negative star ratings, this app would deserve it.

BTW, using the app on an iPhone 8 with iOS 11.1"
"I thought I was gonna get his app while I was in the store and get a free cone, from what it said on the door that was how in worked. Nope. You have to wait 30 hours for the coupon to deliver. The app is also poorly organized, it looks like a collage. Terrible. Half the coupons there also have a catch, such as $3 off and in tiny words that u can barely read says ‚Äúminimum $15 purchase‚Äù. I‚Äôm very dissatisfied and hope they fix their app soon. Because I‚Äôm deleting it. What a waste of space!!"
"Im not sure what happened to the app but it was working perfectly fine. All of a sudden it wont accept my email or password. When I reset it, it still doesn‚Äôt work!! I sign up all over again and the same thing happens with a different email. 
When I go online to log in, it works like the app used to! Can someone please fix this or add coupons to the website? Thanks."
I can‚Äôt believe this app has 4 stars when it does work at all. I was able to register but when I tried to order something it takes us straight to find a store after you select one it does NOTHING! it doesn‚Äôt even have a next button so you are not able to move forward. I try to make an order online as well and it has the same issue. Very frustrating!
"4 stars, overall great except it could be better if they added the merge card balance option. It‚Äôs easier when paying and convenient when you are not using more than one card."
"My boyfriend wanted ice cream from Baskin Robins. I decided to download this app-which surprisingly downloaded pretty fast. I went to look up the ice cream flavors and topping flavors and the stupid app only listed cakes, novelties, pints, it even listed candles-really candles but not the flavors of ice cream. Seriously, the ice cream flavors were not listed. My boyfriends patience wore thin and he left the room frustrated with me! This is a ‚ÄúThanks for nothing‚Äù app. Don‚Äôt waste your time downloading it!"
"Almost every time I use this app, something doesn‚Äôt work. It‚Äôs usually the login. Today it did not accept my password and when I used the app to change it, the recovery email took me outside the app. For the fun of it, I tried to set my not-working password as my new password but it was not accepted because it was already used by me. Then, after actually creating a new password, the app did not recognize it either."
I love Baskin-Robbins but their sometimes don‚Äôt work in registers especially gift cards so k have many gift cards giving to me since they know my kids love their ice cream. I wish I can combine the gift cards just like the one from Dunkin‚Äô Donuts. I wish u guys make this option available. Other than that it‚Äôs updates need more work like able to order online pickup or who knows.
"So I decided to try the app for my kids. Wanted to treat them. The app make it difficult to register. Then saw the deals they had, was excited, but when I went to the store, was told that it was invalid even though I just registered. Even tried to order just a single scoop and the app apparently does NOT allow that at all. So avoid this app unless u want to waste your time."
I just downloaded this app... and i put my birthday as July 27... and when i look at the date a few minutes later... it says 7/25 or 7/26... i dont want those dates i want 7/27... fix please and add a birthdate editing system... i think my only problem right about now is the birthdate... so i don‚Äôt know about the rest of the app
"As a T-Mobile customer, I have been unable to redeem the codes given to us. Using ‚Äúforgot my password‚Äù just sends a new password for their birthday club but doesn‚Äôt help you sign in. As everyone else said, Facebook login probably works but if you can‚Äôt get your app working properly I can‚Äôt imagine you‚Äôd be using my Facebook information responsibly either. I hope T-Mobile drops BR and just gives DD codes until you fix this."
"Don't let them fool you. This is only really an app for custom ordering cakes. There are no coupons here for customers who like ice cream and sundaes. Never any new coupons and sends disruptive push notifications for the same three tired promos. I just don't want a mangonada. I've had the app for over a year, so I think it's fair to say I gave it a good chance!! Just bloats my phone."
"I signed up for this app right before National Ice Cream Day.  I could log in fine and had coupons which included a free single scoop which would expire on July 31.  When I went to use it I could not log into my account.  I reset my password but still could not log in.  It is now a few weeks later and still says error on their end.  So lost my free ice cream.  Well, at least the app did not cost anything hence the 1 star."
Not able reload app with gift card for more than two months. Website doesn‚Äôt have option to redeem gift card. BR is totally crap app and experience. Better to have other ice creams than these. They never forget to spam you even if you unsubscribe. Why there is no zero or negative rating here. Online order never goes through. I will not trust BR with my card details if they have such a crappy tech support.
"I just downloaded with intentions to purchase items for a group. After twenty minutes of futzing around with it, I still cannot figure out how to add items to my shopping cart. This app is laid out differently than others as I don‚Äôt see radio buttons or any kind of ‚Äúadd here‚Äù to add items to my bag. Unless this is a recent bug- someone needs to add what to do to FAQ or somewhere. Thanks. Loyal customer and ex exployee over 30yrs algo."
It would be nice to have a point system going on. For each dollar you spend you can gain points towards a feee scoop etc
"Why in the world would I need an app, if it doesn‚Äôt even have fingerprint/face ID login? I thought that‚Äôs the main reason to have an app? So you can log in easily? If it doesn‚Äôt do that, why do I need an app? I could just log in with the browser...
I‚Äôm not really using the app, except to use a coupon occasionally, but that log in thing really bugs me. It‚Äôs 2019!"
So Baskin Robbins and Dunkin‚Äô Donuts are pretty much the same company. So how come on the DD app you can merge all of your card balances but you can‚Äôt do that on the BR app ? It‚Äôs such a pain to go to the store and swipe through several cards to pay and start a line of people behind me as the cashier is patiently trying to scan them all. Please fix this and make it just like the DD app and let us finally merge our card balances.
"One annoying thing is you cannot merge balances from different cards stored in the app into one card. I loaded several $2 cards I received into the app and each one had to be scanned separately at checkout, not the end of the world but it makes an otherwise quick transaction take longer than it should."
I think up occasions to buy a BR cake! They always are fresh and beautiful. The Kanawha City store does an excellent job. The designs are perfect and I‚Äôve never had an order that was wrong in any way.
Always greeted with a smile! They go out of their way even when they probably don‚Äôt want to so they provide great customer service.  Worth a ‚Äúcheat‚Äù day!
"This is one of the worst food apps I have ever used. It continuously crashes to the point where I can‚Äôt even sign in. It also signs me out every time I close the app but gives me difficulty with signing in too. Now thanks to this terrible app, I can‚Äôt even access the gift cards I have linked to this account. Totally frustrated."
"I‚Äôve never used an app for a store/ restaurant that is so bad. There has to be bots rating this 5 stars because it‚Äôs a 2 at best. It‚Äôs so difficult to order on and a very strange set up. The designer needs to be fired. Also, it‚Äôs very glitchy and doesn‚Äôt include the whole menu when you want to order takeout. You can‚Äôt even order a cone or anything like that. Quite a strange app."
"Update 7/10: After this newest update, this app is worse even more!! No way to log in except using facebook even though I‚Äôve always have an account!!! So now I can‚Äôt add my gift cards anymore!!!

It has a bunch of things but they are mostly useless and takes forever to load anything! And THEY NEED TO HAVE A FEATURE TO COMBINE ALL THE GIFT CARDS INTO ONE AKA TRANSFER MONEY FROM ONE GIFT CARD TO ANOTHER! Even dunkin donuts has that feature!!!"
"You can‚Äôt or barely can scroll down when loading a gift card. Sometimes tapping on things won‚Äôt apply it. I lost a gift card because I never made an account, once I did the gift card was still missing.

You can‚Äôt even combined the gift cards so you waste time and space scrolling for cards.

A lot of things can be removed to make the app more usable and appealing."
"I was at the register trying to check out when the app decided to not let me use it because I had an outdated version. It prompted me to click ok to upgrade which I did and nothing happened. This took some time to upgrade. Then my free scoop
Of ice cream which you get when you download the app showed up in stores as not valid. This app is a joke, kind of like the stores. Get it together and hire a new IT team."
"I have been trying to order birthday ice cream cake for the past three days via both web and app, but both app/web have been freezing, and cannot place an order. called a local store but no one is picking up the phone üò≠ these technical issues need to be thawed through!!"
It continues to change when my birthday is and honestly that was the only reason I even got the app in the first place. It‚Äôs saying my birthday was a few days ago when it isn‚Äôt until later this week. I know it‚Äôs only a few days but I wanted to fix it and all it does is make it worse. It crashes and takes forever to load. Not worth it
"Cant merge cards together I have about 50 in there right now. Email customer service which takes 2-3 days for a reply saying they are able to merge cards so emailed back all the card numbers, took another 2-3 days for a reply saying they could only merge 10 cards........ PLEASE make it available on the app to merge cards so it‚Äôs easier for BR workers and for others with the app."
"Worse app ever, that‚Äôs a joke that this app won‚Äôt let you merge balance into one card I‚Äôm a T-Mobile Tuesday customer and I get them when they have this option but it‚Äôs ridiculous that I have to keep several gift cards in this app. It looks that Baskin-Robbins doesn‚Äôt care about this issue since I‚Äôm not the only one complaining about it and they still haven‚Äôt fix it."
"This app is worthless and cannot be used to order on an IPhone.  When it is asking for an expiration date for the credit card, it does not automatically input a ‚Äú/‚Äú between the month and year.  Only problem is there is no ‚Äú/‚Äú on the keyboard.  Avoid this useless product at all cost...."
I was really interested in the stranger things promotion sweepstakes but it seems like everyone has the same issues. The password doesn‚Äôt work after you‚Äôve already downloaded the app and made an account. it‚Äôs all a scam to make you download their stupid app. maybe i would‚Äôve kept it with the rest of my barely used apps in a folder but y‚Äôall like to lie so here we are.
"I downloaded this app hoping to be able to order my drinks and was unsuccessful due to them not offering Baskin Robbins shakes, cappuccino blast etc. Also I was going to order my daughter cake but it doesn‚Äôt give you the option to change the color icing. So I guess now I have no choice but to go into the store."
"It‚Äôs so frustrating when you have to sign into an app every single time you use it. I don‚Äôt remember this being a problem before the last few weeks. Now every time I close the app, it logs me out. It doesn‚Äôt even give an option to stay logged in or ‚Äúremember me‚Äù or even allow for Touch ID/Facial ID. This app is seriously disappointing!"
"The app is barely functional, it lets you add gift cards but doesn‚Äôt let you merge the balances if you have more than one. And it doesn‚Äôt even let you add money onto your gift card! I believe it‚Äôs time for an update that gives the ability to do both. Every other apps like this one will let you add money and merge balances so I don‚Äôt know why your app doesn‚Äôt."
You need to update the app so you can login in with Facebook. I have been having issues for a while. Even deleted the app because I couldn‚Äôt login with Facebook. Update please.
The app is just okay but the thing that you really need to update it in it is to allow us to merge the balances of different gift cards in one card
My only complaint is that there still is no feature to combine the value of your gift cards! I get T-Mobile gift cards to BR sometimes and I have a lot stored up. Dunkin‚Äô Donuts already has the feature so why can‚Äôt I have that feature too?
Can‚Äôt get a gift card and I‚Äôve tried multiple cards but always get error. It won‚Äôt load the menu items and actually shows nothing under the options. Not really great if you are trying to use it for selling items.
"App isn‚Äôt great. It shouldn‚Äôt be that difficult for a company of this size to have a somewhat-functional app.

App desperately needs to not log me out of my account every 48 hours or so, needs to reliably reflect gift card balances, and needs to be able to merge gift card balances.

Please fix this app."
"Went to Baskin thought I was going to use the coupon clicked it but they no longer had what I wanted. Heading to another location and the coupon was gone!! What‚Äôs the point of erasing an unused coupon? If it is not scanned allow customers to at least use it rather than delete it!! Very unfortunate, decided to just go home."
"Why can't you update app so we can MERGE gift cards? Dunkin Donuts did that a few months ago and it's working out great. Please consider merging soon!
Also, I tried using one of my several gift cards in the app and the store couldn't access it. I had to wind up paying cash. Why??"
"Love the App, but my opinion is the deals should be changed a bit more frequently."
"I always have trouble with the app loading when I am looking for the latest deals. Sometimes I will have full reception, but it still won‚Äôt load. It makes it difficult to access the app when I need to."
My city had a new Baskin- Robbins open a month ago and they still haven‚Äôt added it to the app. I can‚Äôt even order ahead or look at the menu which is convenient given the drive thru is always very busy.
"This app is garbage! It worked for awhile and still wasn‚Äôt working as it should, but when I tried logging in yesterday it completely stopped. I tried logging in and can‚Äôt. I tried changing the password and still was unable to log in. I‚Äôm glad that I didn‚Äôt have a balance left on this worthless garbage."
"I have the Dunkin Doughnuts app, and it allows for card merging and adding to Apple Wallet, I don‚Äôt understand why the Baskin-Robbins app doesn‚Äôt. They are the same company! I‚Äôm having a hard time understanding who at Baskin-Robbins thinks the merging of gift cards and the ability to add gift cards to Apple Wallet is a bad idea. As a consumer, those things would elevate my shopping experience."
First off this is probably the worst food or restaurant app there is no coupons no deals no rewards club no buy one deals nothing there is no point of the app
"When I updated my email address to a new one, my gift cards won‚Äôt show up in the app. If I can‚Äôt see them from the app, there‚Äôs no way to use them.

I had to update it back to my old email address to be able to see and use those gift cards again."
"This is the worst app ever. I won a $20 gift card and tried to put the balance on this App. When I tried to use it, the clerk said it‚Äôs showing the card as invalid and wouldn‚Äôt honor the balance on the app. Not only did my friend pay for a worthless $20 gift card, I had to shell out the full balance to pay for my purchase. Double dipping, not cool Baskin Robbins!"
"Can't even access my shopping cart on your app OR in your site. Everytime I try all I get is ""Error, looks like we're frozen."" Your ability to service us online, whether through your app or website, is nothing short of frustrating."
"First time I tried the app, I couldn‚Äôt get the deal for an ice cream cake on my phone. No service in restaurant to show them the
 deal. I tried again for another time months later at a different store, same exact thing happened again!!! What good is the app? All my other apps seems to work fine, no problem. üëéüèºüëéüèº"
"Even though card shows $2 balance in app, when stores scan it, they say there‚Äôs nothing on card. When I look at transaction history all it shows is the date I created it. What a ripoff!!!"
"I believe this app is great in every way. But I will not give five stars until it gives you the option of staying logged in. Better yet, how about putting the finger scanner or face recognition as way to log in."
"I love their ice cream, and occasionally use coupon offers, but this app is horrible.  Every time I open it, it asks for the email and password to login - what‚Äôs the point of having an app?  Also, when I click on ‚Äúcontact us‚Äù it just goes back to the main screen, so obviously they don‚Äôt want feedback or questions."
My one request would be a way to rate flavors so i can track my favorites through that app.
"This app is not user friendly in the least. It crashes often, you have to sign into it every single time, it doesn‚Äôt even give an option to save your user name. I love having a new Baskin Robbins in my neighborhood but this app leaves a lot to be desired."
It‚Äôs an app that‚Äôs straight and to the point. from paying with gift cards and coupons to finding locations.  Just would love to see the option to merge gift cards amounts to one.
"Would be nice if you can add an option to merge the gift card balance, similar to feature available in Dunkin' Donuts mobile app. It's a sweet feature to manage the balance in one card than to have multiple cards..."
Give the option of merging card balances! I have 6 different gift cards now and should not have to scan multiple cards just for 1 purchase! Makes me not wanna ask for gift cards from you guys as gifts!
"Can‚Äôt add BR cards to Apple Wallet and that‚Äôs a shame. Another app that has to be opened (with it‚Äôs multiple steps and loading times) to use it‚Äôs payment card. Add Apple Wallet support with geolocation to offer it in the lock screen, please, and then I will consider going more often to a BR."
"Baskin-Robbins, we really need a feature that allows us to combine all our gift cards like Dunkin‚Äô Donuts or Starbucks app. Also why do I have to keep logging in when I open app after some days"
What the hell is the point to offer an App if you cannot even use it. Most stores don‚Äôt have WiFi and the few stores that my internet works at doesn‚Äôt take the gift cards through the app. Either update the app or train your employees how to take payment through the app.
"I hope that on the next upgrade they install a merge balance option, it‚Äôd come in handy... ohhh and also if their barcodes could be compatible with their in-store scanners... other than that it‚Äôs okay to use"
"There was an error on my birthday. I tried to correct it, but it keeps on changing to the day before that date automatically."
"Use to be able to get a lil bit off with the deals section having coupons but that is no longer the case only advertisements for new flavors or stuff all without discounts 
I‚Äôm deleting this app!"
"Hello, I didn‚Äôt see any option to merge the balance from one gift card to another gift card. Why can you add that option. Your other brand, Dunkin‚Äô app allow us to merge balance from one card to another."
Plain and simple this app is not very good.  Card reload is disabled and you can not combine your cards which is annoying.  Please learn from your counterpart over at Dunkin Ds their app is far superior compared to this one. Even you have have to take theirs and reskin it with a Baskin Robbins theme it would surely work better than this one.
"I selected a site and when I click order it doesn‚Äôt have the option for normal ice cream or shakes. It only says cakes, diy, novelty, or quarts... there is also no option to search and the app is super cluttered. Useless since I have to do everything I‚Äôd do in the app in person afterward."
"I visit BR regularly (at least 1-2x a month, more in the summer) but not often enough to remember which email and password go with this app and it‚Äôs incredibly annoying to have to look it up every. Single. Time."
"App won‚Äôt let me login when it used to leave me logged in. It can tell my credentials are valid because it correctly errors with a wrong password, but a login attempt with correct credentials swirls and comes right back to the same screen. I have saved gift cards I want to use. ‚òπÔ∏è"
"App is totally useless, doesn‚Äôt let you see menu or order ice cream. And don‚Äôt trust the payment card to update in real time. It may show a balance when in reality you don‚Äôt have any $ left."
"This app is pretty pointless. The whole point of having is so that I can use it to pay without having any inconvenience, but it‚Äôs so bothersome to pay when I can‚Äôt merge the balances of different gift cards!!! Horrible app. Please listen to other users and fix this issue!"
"Could not believe a company like Baskin and Robins will have a application like this. Thats a shame on companies reputation. Guys if your developers are not working properly just out source the job to some cheap company, trust me they will make a better application than this one. Worse performance app."
"The interface is intuitive, but in both the app and browser website it crashes when trying to process the order. BR needs to figure out the 21st century. For now I‚Äôll be calling the local store by phone maybe..."
"Overall, this is a helpful app, but I would like to see a link to the nutrition info on it, as well, if you would, please. Thanks."
"This app is garbage. You should be able to order from it to your local store. At the very least be able to call your store from it. It gets one star only because it has a good visual menu. But that takes you no where, you can‚Äôt order from it."
I only Have this app because of T-Mobile Tuesdays. You cannot merge cards so it‚Äôs embarrassing when you have to use like five different gift cards. Plus there‚Äôs no point in downloading this app because there‚Äôs no point reward system or anything like that. Fix the app and I‚Äôll fix my review.
"I downloaded the app so my son could pick his ice cream before we went to Baskin-Robbins but nothing on the menu is coming up. Hopefully it‚Äôs just a bug and will be fixed soon but until then, it‚Äôs just a waste of storage space."
The app is great except for it won‚Äôt update the gift card balances. It keeps showing the old balances so it‚Äôs hard to know what is on any of my gift cards.
Need to be able to merge or transfer card balances to 1 card. This app is so behind on the times. So stupid that I have to pay for a $15 purchase and have them scan of my T-Mobile $2 gift cards 7 to 8 separate times.
This app would be so much better if there was a rewards incentive for members. This would make me more inclined to visit the shop more frequently.
Please add an option to merge gift card balances. Thank you in advance!
Came in and tried to us a coupon.   Accidentally hit done before employee could scan it and he wouldn‚Äôt give us the discount.
I bought a gift card with an offer of you buy $20 then $5 will be added to my account. I received the notification that I will get$5 but I never received the $5 in my baskin robin account. Not sure what is going on
The balance remaining on the card does not update! You have to go to the transaction history in order to see the redemption amount and subtract those amounts to get the true balance amount left on the card!
Can‚Äôt preorder. Find an item of interest then call the closest store only for the phone to ring a million times when finally someone answers but act clueless when requesting what seems to be a ‚Äústandard item‚Äù. Don‚Äôt install. Delete. Waste of time and energy.
"It‚Äôs a great app with promotions and coupons and store location.
Only disappointment is that I can‚Äôt merge my old card and new card. Wish they have merging capability."
"I have a lot of gift cards stored in the app but have been unable to use them because I cannot login to the app. It has been this way for months. Error communicating with server. A01. 
Fix it."
"I can‚Äôt log in anymore, therefore all of my gift card balance is lost. It doesn‚Äôt matter how many times I reset my password. It used to work ok. Maybe I should never have updated to the latest version."
I really can‚Äôt check my gift card that I‚Äôve received so I can‚Äôt really know how much money there really is in my card unless i go to the actual store and find out
"Downloaded, changed password, tried 6 times to get phone verification to work. Still failed. Closed and reopened and just spinning now. We don‚Äôt live near any BR but we are currently traveling and would like to stop. I have an envie for a peanut butter chocolate cone."
"And another app that you can‚Äôt effectively give feedback to, even though the app is completely broken right now. I can‚Äôt login, it access my gift cards. Really? Can you please hire people that actually can program?"
I clicked x on a deal but then the timer started and I got there 10 seconds too late and they just said oh well! I showed them I had the app and told them what happened but they asked me to pay even though you can see I only brought a dollar for tax. It should be no stars
App was just updated today to ‚Äúimprove gift card usability‚Äù but STILL UNABLE TO MERGE GIFT CARDS!!! Their Dunkin‚Äô app has been able to do this for a long time now.  BR programmers need to pick up the phone and ask Dunkin programmers how to get it done. Heck just copy their app and rename it BR. Cmon it‚Äôs 2019 for Pete‚Äôs sake!!!
Unable to fix glitch when the app freezes.
"Please allow balances to merge from multiple cards.  It would be way more convenient to use just one card when paying vs multiple cards.  Other retailers (Starbucks, Dunkin‚Äô Donuts, etc) has this function, why can‚Äôt BR do the same?"
It takes 5 minutes to load app and even then it takes another to login which then it will crash a few times before it allows you to finally log in.
I have 7 gift cards that when scanned I am told ‚ÄúIt says can‚Äôt read barcode‚Äù by the cashier who stands there until you give up and pay cash. It‚Äôs a total scam! The app even says the amount of money on each card but it won‚Äôt let you use it. DO NOT USE THIS APP TO PURCHASE GIFT CARDS BECAUSE ALL THEY ARE DOING IS STEALING YOUR MONEY!!!
"It looks pretty at a surface, but apparently you need a baskin robins card to do anything and I can‚Äôt even put gift cards in as the payment method :/"
Won‚Äôt allow me to log on via Facebook anymore. And when I changed my account info through the web page I am able to log on but still not able to log on through the app.
It‚Äôs annoying having to login all the time.
I don't understand why you can't transfer total amounts to other cards.... I have a bunch of two dollar cards when they should be together. And also freezes all the time and wouldn't let me even sign in this morning
"Their website said I could order mobile gift cards if I get the app, so I got it. Can‚Äôt see anywhere how to order a gift card. Good expectations blown."
my only gripe with the app is that i can not merge the card balances. i often get the weekly tmobile baskin robbins deals but its frustrating that i have multiple low balance cards when it would me much easier to be able to put them all in one card. this would also make check out a while lot easier since i wouldn‚Äôt have to scan a bunch of different cards
"Literally the worst app I‚Äôve ever downloaded. Made an account, added a gift card, tried to add another, then the app crashed. Tried to login again and it doesn‚Äôt let me login at all. Then I opened it an hour later and I was logged in...but now with a $0 balance."
"This app only occasionally worked in the past with hit/miss luck even when it did work if the particular Baskin Robbin branch would even accept the coupon when shown in-app. One branch in particular where ANY coupons from ANY app or source ARE NOT ACCEPTED include the Baskin Robbins at Northgate Mall, Seattle."
"My wife, grandkids, and I love Basking Robins ice cream variety and the great coupons and special offers, an excellent motivational factor."
Everything is good but the portion of d scoop is extremely small
I‚Äôve had the Dunkin app for several years now. It is exceptional. I just downloaded the BR app and am very unimpressed. Why can‚Äôt this app be as good as the Dunkin app? Or better yet combine the two!!
"I used to use the app to redeem reward. But nowadays since I changed my phone, I can‚Äôt log in manually or through Facebook. Guess I‚Äôm not going to BR anymore since I‚Äôm not paying full price"
"My $20 gift card was taken away from this ridiculous app when I wanted to add all my values to one card. You have also ""temporarily disabled"" the reloading function, which seems this app close to useless payment-wise."
"The first store I tried to use the pay function, it didn‚Äôt work. According to the employee it happens frequently.

Why do you have only 5 minutes to use a coupon? I thought 05:00 was 5 hours. Even then WHY??? I‚Äôm logged in."
"This app use to be good when they had all Ice Cream Flavors on the App, BUT for whatever reason‚Ä¶. They took the Ice Cream flavors off?? WHAT THE HECK!! I‚Äôll keep the App in case the app mysteriously puts the flavors back on, but come on Baskin Robbins!! ADD THE FLAVORS OF YOUR ICE CREAM BACK ON OR YOUR APP IS USELESS!!!"
"Your ice cream is overpriced for quality offered. 

Usually only worth going to when have special deals. Only time the ice cream is worth the bargain. With the pandemic‚Äôs arrival this brand of ice cream went downhill. Not for quality but service."
Everything‚Äôs fine just constantly having to log in is annoying asf
The app is lacking the ability to merge your existing gift card balance into another gift card.  A necessity since they partnered with T-Mobile and give out weekly gift cards.
My app hasn‚Äôt worked for months - can‚Äôt reload it and have been waiting for a fix!
"I recently signed up for a rewards account on the Baskin-Robbins website, downloaded this App, and the App returns a communication with network error. Bad job Baskin-Robbins, please fix this app."
Found it difficult to navigate with sections not clearly defined. Deleted and went in store to complete purchase.
"Tried multiple times downloading the app on the iPhone and it does not give me the option to order - see just the pics 
This needs to be corrected"
This app is pointless. Anytime I want to redeem an offer they make you print out a barcode‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs the point of the app then! So annoyed and frustrated will not be coming back to any BR location.
"Please add card merge feature, Dunkin Donuts have this feature and it saves lot of time managing those cards vs one card where you can merge all your balances."
This app is really horrible. It suddenly logged me off on the app. And then i just couldn‚Äôt sign in using my credentials. It displays no error message. My credentials are correct as i signed in using the same on the website
"App does not let me stay logged in, I have to reenter my email and password every time. Will not let you paste the gift card number from T-mobile. Also keyboard covers field you want to type in."
App is terrible compared to Dunkin‚Äô Donuts app. And why can you still not merge gift cards? Dunkin has had this feature for more than a year. App needs to be cleaned up and the ability to merge gift cards needs to be added.
"The app won‚Äôt let me log in. I can log in on the website, but not the app. Because of this I can not access any local deals via the app. Please fix, thank you."
What is even the point of this app? Every other food app I have gives me the option to order from the app. On this I can only browse the menu and create a card. Waste of space.
"Wish they would allow merging of gift cards already.  I get promo cards from T-Mobile and am not able to merge so I have to give the cashier multiple cards
To scan on my app.   Very annoying."
"If you have more than one card, you should be able to merge you balances to one card"
"There needs to be an option where users can merge balance. If there were multiple cards linked on the app, there is no option to merge the balance."
Can you add support for combining gift cards??? It‚Äôs a hassle for both the customer and cashier when you are paying with several cards.
Please make a app and website that are actually user friendly. Also it would be great to see current flavors at a selected shop.
I am so sick of you ugly freak idiots lying ü§• to me. I‚Äôm done with that. You deleted a lot of good flavors like the mudslide. Now me and my son have to eat chocolate and more. This is really stupid. I think you dumb dammites deserve a one star ‚≠êÔ∏è rate.
Why do I need to provide a phone number to get ice cream coupons for an account that is already set up with my email?
It would be nice if allowed combining of gift cards on the app.  Sometimes the app would just crash
I have many gift cards on my account and I haven‚Äôt been able to log into my account for months. Always an error communicating to the server... please fix
"I am able to login through website, but not able to login through this app."
"This apps need to have an option to merge gift cards, have so many different t-mobile $2 BR gift and want to merge them into one.."
Coupon deal disappeared immediately after updating. Won‚Äôt open anymore. New version should be squished and thrown away.
"The FB link doesn‚Äôt work. I have reset this account numerous times. I can log in on the website, but the app won‚Äôt get past the log in page. So frustrating."
"I needed to be updated!!  I now am!!
Maybe this is why I haven‚Äôt been receiving  specials and my birthday cone Ice cream.
Thanks for the update!"
I have multiple gift cards from here but it‚Äôs frustrating not being able to combine them all on the app
The images look really nice but nothing I click shows a price or a way to order. So disappointing!!
"This app makes you relogin every time you open the app. Also it keeps changing my birthday date, I wasn‚Äôt able to get my free scoop because of the screw up. It‚Äôs very inconvenient as a whole."
All I want from this app is a way to conveniently pay with an e-gift card. It does not deliver. Seriously just let me merge gift cards and pay with them and I‚Äôll be completely happy with the app.
"Every single time ive tried to use this app while inside a store ive had to go outside to activate an app. no, this isnt because of my service, as other apps DO work inside. Uninstalled."
"Birthday is wrong and you can‚Äôt fix it.

Won‚Äôt let me log on. I‚Äôve already reset my account several times because it never recognizes the password

This app is trash"
"So can‚Äôt order a scoop, can‚Äôt order a milkshake, can‚Äôt order anything contactless, can‚Äôt order anything personal. So let‚Äôs infect the world."
"App doesn‚Äôt work, you can‚Äôt log in, sign up w/ facebook or email, constantly crashing/error messages, totally useless and a waste of time. Baskin Robbins, please join us in the year 2019 and create a functioning app."
Please get this fixed. I have numerous gift cards on your app and I cannot access them.
"Downloaded this and most of it doesn‚Äôt do anything. Can‚Äôt find prices, it wouldn‚Äôt order anything, couldn‚Äôt add to the shopping cart. What‚Äôs the point?"
I went to baskin Robbins to pay with my gift cards which are loaded on the app. I got my ice cream but when it was time to pay I waited a long time before the cashier said it wasn‚Äôt working.
Why do you make your customers login to the app every time? It makes the app very difficult to use.
"EVERY time I go to use this app, it has logged me out. Super annoying. It‚Äôs 2019 and the developers can‚Äôt figure out how to keep us logged in to their app. Makes me never want use the app."
"I have my favorite flavor and 
I visit this store about 1 per month."
"Not many options in the app. Can‚Äôt order for store pick up. Can‚Äôt merge gift cards, so when paying at the store need to show each card one at a time."
"You have to be a complete moron to design an app like this. Everything is completely counterintuitive, with multiple redundant features and absolutely no idea how to build simple UI architecture. Fix this, Baskin Robbins. Your ice cream is good, technology not."
"Get locations of stores and pictures of cakes. That‚Äôs. It. No information about the cakes, can‚Äôt order the cake, no price, serving size, ingredients, etc. THE most worthless app that has EVER had the privilege of being on my phone."
Tried to order DIY kit for family night and nothing worked. Wasted of time don‚Äôt waste time and download
Baskin Robbins‚Äô website specifically says this app is used to send e-gifts via text message but thar is not possible. I am so disappointed.
I think they should add a point system type of thing like other nation wide food company
"The products are delicious. However, the app is complicated. Can you add the merge balance function? It‚Äôll be awesome."
"You cannot transfer balances of card to other cards, I‚Äôve never had it work seamlessly at a store (their registers won‚Äôt accept scan)"
"This app needs an update almost daily. It rarely loads and when it does, it‚Äôs a waste of time. I need my sanity more than the ice cream, so this app has to go."
"You used to be able to log in to your account via the app, but no longer.  Just hangs on the login screen."
Still can‚Äôt add gift card to gather so I have like eight cards be nice if you could just do that you know Dunkin‚Äô Donuts does that
Useless. None of the stores around me list their flavors- and the ones that do only list 11. So what‚Äôs the point if you can‚Äôt see all the flavors?
"Had to create account online, because it didn‚Äôt work on app. Still unable to login on app."
The App has all our Birthday dates wrong and doesn‚Äôt allow to change. Very Frustrating.
"Can‚Äôt log in, reset and it works in a browser, app still can‚Äôt log in after many tries. So not worth the trouble."
Need to put merge card available in the app. I have 10 cards that can‚Äôt merge together so purchasing ice cream in store is a hassle. Reload money in app is always down. Please fix it.
"Tried to redeem my birthday ice cream but every time I refreshed the screen, the days went backwards and I never was able to recieve anything."
Kind of useless.. no way to place order. Same facility had Dunkin Donuts which I use mobile order all the time.
Same issues no ability to merge balance .
