0,Like it,"I have been using this app for over a year and I like it a lot. I’m giving it 4 stars only because the coupons could be better and being a member could get you more coupons, but they give you only 3 good coupons for the month and that’s all. I would like to see better coupons and more of them, especially since you have some very loyal customers! That’s just me though and only my opinion.",4,Nick old nick,2019-10-13 16:10:56,False,Baskin Robbins
1,Barely working,"I do not have a plastic B-R card so having the T-Mobile offer was an opportunity to download the App and create a virtual card since it may be the end of April, but it’s still too cold for ice cream and the promo value will expire shortly if not transferred to a gift card. I much prefer a virtual card.
This App is not at all intuitive when trying to apply the T-Mobile promo to a new virtual card. I eventually got it to work after several attempts and apologies from the App about the App not being able to add the promo at that time. I did it a few days ago and may have gone through the website since the App was being difficult.
Now I have a second T-Mobile promo I wanted to add to my existing virtual card and that feature is not possible as a reload at this time. I tried creating an additional virtual card and that is also not possible at this time according to the App which says I can do it online or in the store.
If the T-Mobile offer was going to exacerbate an already disfunction App you are only further embarrassing B-R and T-Mobile before the App could accommodate the T-Mobile offer.
I will try the website again but whether I succeed or fail that doesn’t change my opinion of the App.",1,Kplan23,2018-04-22 18:10:37,False,Baskin Robbins
2,Terrible App!,"I did the whole 9 yards-the app, my info, took forever to even maneuver it…
sent my best friend not one but TWO gift cards-of course, my $ pulled from my bank right away. I know my bf’s info by heart. Her email has NEVER changed-she NEVER got either card. Have YRIED to get through to someone for a solution but to no avail. I’m a disabled veteran with hands/fingers that barely work…only stating this because I spent SOOO much time filling out every little thing B-R’s asked for and got NOTHING for ALL that time & trouble!!  Someone somewhere got paid w/ my $!! 
Waist of my time!
(Salt in the wound-just recently one of our only 2 stores just folded up & went away. Now we have one. Only ONE-and to bring my business to them-it’s a 40 minute drive 1-way. LOVE the couple that runs it but considering most all of us take the time to download an app to be able to get some kind of a coupon or treat from time to time and ice cream prices have gone up like everything else…just a sad deal.

3,Timer for coupons?!,"I love Baskin Robbins but this app is probably the worst restaurant/store app I’ve ever used. It crashed while I was making an account and now my birthday is wrong and there’s no way to fix it. I went in today to use a coupon offered in the app, only to find there was a timer once activated. It said “5:00” and I assumed that must mean 5 hours, but actually it was 5 minutes! By the time it was my turn it coupon was gone. Fortunately the store has excellent customer service and honored the coupon anyway even though I didn’t even ask for them to since it was my mistake for “activating” the coupon too early. This timer for coupons is completely ridiculous and I can’t see any benefit to the customer or the stores for having such an aggravating feature. I am deleting this app, and encourage others to avoid this app altogether.",2,MrsKM5,2018-06-15 00:01:21,False,Baskin Robbins
4,Was Nice When It Worked,"I’ve had this app for a while and have used it to order cakes for family events a few times. It was great, because I could put the information in and it just worked, and that’s all I wanted. 

But since the latest app update, I can’t check out. I enter all my credit card information (which, by the way, why can’t a major company like this use Apple Pay so that I don’t have to manually type my credit card?! It is 2021!) and all my contact information, and the “complete order” button at the bottom just doesn’t do anything. No errors, I’m not missing any fields - it’s just like the button isn’t there at all. 

Yikes. If your app is literally preventing people from buying your products, it may be time for a do-over.",1,sallyfour,2021-05-08 19:01:16,False,Baskin Robbins
5,Crashed when trying to use coupon.,"I love Baskin Robbins but this app is horrible. Probably the worst food app I’ve ever used. Really counterintuitive. I tried to order a cake through it and even though the cake was $45 and it was the only thing in the cart, it said the grand total was $180?!! So I call the store to order. When I go to pick it up, I try to redeem the $5 off coupon I have and right when I click the coupon it says “unhandled exception occurred” and then the reward disappeared. The lousy thing is the store wouldn’t even honor the discount after I told them about the issue. I mean I know they aren’t the ones responsible for the app but it’s just bad business all around. Nice trick on pretending I’ll get a discount when I won’t.",1,EstherJP,2021-11-24 02:37:10,False,Baskin Robbins
6,Worthless app,"I have been unsuccessful In trying to order a cake for my son’s birthday in a few days.  I get all the way through picking out the design, cake variety, ice cream flavor and message, but when I actually go try to checkout, I get an error message—“Error: Looks like we’re frozen.”  It’s very annoying.  I’ve tried logging out then logging back in, restarting my phone, uninstalling and reinstalling the app, but I get the same result every single time.  In going back through all the app reviews here, it seems like the same problems were there from years ago and nothing was fixed.  I guess Baskin & Robbins just doesn’t care that they have a craptastic app.",1,KiraKiraMeansSparkle,2021-12-29 00:47:11,False,Baskin Robbins
7,Not worth it,"I don’t even know where to start. I’ve tried to order a few different cakes through this app. I ended up having to go in to the store to do it because the apps wouldn’t accept payment. The app was slow and awkward for ordering. 

Also, I get notifications that there are new coupons on the app. Coupons. Their word. Not mine. I have never gotten a coupon nor have I gotten a deal under their deals. I exclusively get promotions. Try one of this drink or this new flavor or we have cakes for graduation. Those are not coupons. Those are not deals. 

DQ has a great app. Their ice cream may not be as good as BR but the app is worth having. It’s time to for me to delete the BR app.",1,HailNAyrCad,2021-09-16 21:18:43,False,Baskin Robbins
8,"Love you guys, buuuut.....","Baskin Robbins is an amazing company to me and I love it always. What would make me a much better, and happier, is if their digital options to purchase didn’t only come from Door Dash. I’ve been hoping, and waiting patiently for the app to update properly to make it so I can order online ice cream and cakes but I haven’t been lucky. While I can buy some flavors in Fred Meyer, I want to support this franchise directly because my favorite flavor is actually “Daiquiri Ice” & “Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough”. 
I also tried ordering on the website thinking “there’s no way this doesn’t work” and I was wrong. Please fix both of them so that we can all enjoy what we grew up on. I would love to see you guys thrive into the future.",1,phissyj,2020-03-01 05:43:53,False,Baskin Robbins
9,App and websites both don’t work!,"After wasting 20+mins on its website and its app (cuz the website didn’t work so I tried to download its app as well), the checkout process still couldn’t complete but showing me the same error message which I do not know what went wrong. After four attempts I’m totally fed up and will order with some other shop after I leave this review. In addition, they are asking way too much personal info for ordering a cake, you are required to leave your address and phone number and email no matter what (sign in as guest or sign up or pick up only).",1,MissLaLaLie,2022-03-05 18:50:25,False,Baskin Robbins
10,Inability to Merge Gift Cards via App,"Surely a business like this can manage to create the option for its app users to merge the gift cards they receive. I find it a bit ridiculous having to e-mail customer service to complete an otherwise simple task. It’s also a hassle to use the separate gift cards off the mobile app in store...slows down the progression of the line and makes for uncomfortable exchanges. Otherwise, a decent app. New flavors and promotions are always up to date and the notifications are sound.",3,EmsterQueen,2018-07-11 03:36:46,False,Baskin Robbins
11,Baskin Robbins app: not as advertised; total disappointment,"When a business offers a perk BASED on the condition that you get their app, my experience is that most deliver on their promises. Not this one. After over a week of it not working, I went to my local BR & showed them & asked them to help. The bottom line is that they had no solution & didn’t seem to care. As I was about to order my sundae (anyway), I felt a sense of having been duped. Instead, I said I had to go & give this app 0 stars- which I WISH was an option. If you want the app to facilitate buying more Baskin Robbins products, get it. If you want it for the perks or promises, good luck.",1,pjtv,2019-05-25 04:55:15,False,Baskin Robbins
12,App needs to be fixed,This app used to be great when it worked. And being that there must be some sort of partnership with the app developers who do the Dunkin’ app I put the blame on them for all the issues logging in to the apps. Until they can resolve this error communicating with server issues I will not be going to either Baskin Robbins or Dunkin if I can’t access the coupons and gift card balances I have with them.,3,Delirious453,2020-05-20 18:50:48,False,Baskin Robbins
13,Pointless.,"What is the point of this app even existing if you can’t actually mobile order a cone, a milkshake or a sundae on it? You can only buy cakes and quarts of ice cream. Then you get in the drive-thru and have to wait too long to put in your order, even though there’s only one other car in line. Then you tell them what you want and you have to repeat it because they didn’t hear you say it the first time. 🙄🤦🏼‍♂️ Epic FAIL. Plus the app isn’t very intuitive or user friendly, it’s a bit stiff. Whoever designed this needs to be fired from the UI/UX team ASAP!!!!!!! 👏🏻👏🏻😂",1,Jazz_Risenhoover,2021-08-31 04:38:40,False,Baskin Robbins
14,This app is so frustrating!,"I wanted to buy a birthday cake for my father, but the app won’t let me complete the checkout. It keeps freezing, and I’ve tried repeatedly to get it to work only to be met with the “Sorry looks like we’re frozen!” notification. There’s way too many loading errors on the app in general. The layout for the app is just clunky, there’s no search bar so you have to scroll through all their cakes in order to find the one you’re looking for. I just wanted to buy a birthday cake but man....this app makes it impossible",1,Aviibearr,2020-07-01 20:39:19,False,Baskin Robbins
15,Gift cards,"I could do everything fine on the app but I got a bunch of T-Mobile Tuesdays offers which are only $2 each, and there’s no way to combine the offers. Also, it truly bugs me that I can’t use them online and I couldn’t sign into my account online to order a cake for my sisters birthday. I had to get myself to the store, choose one of the few cakes they had, and then use the gift cards one at a time. The poor people behind me had to wait about 15 minutes, and I had to give my phone to the cashier many separate times. It was embarrassing and utterly unacceptable.",1,Alyssa12322,2018-09-29 02:11:45,False,Baskin Robbins
16,App Crashes Every 5 Minutes,"This app is terrible. It won’t let me log in at all. I’ve already tried deleting and re-downloading the app and changing my password. And Baskin-Robbins prompted me to log into their website and I go to the website and it says I can only log in on the app... which the app won’t allow me to do. The coupon timer is ridiculous and the stupidest thing I’ve ever experienced. Also some Baskin Robbins locations DO NOT HONOR THE COUPONS! When the app was somewhat working, every time I clicked it, it had logged me out again. Guys there’s a reason this app has 2 stars...",1,lannayanna,2019-08-01 08:00:45,False,Baskin Robbins
17,Cheated with the coupon,"I decided to splurge on a budget to treat my daughter to ice cream since I had a coupon. We got 2 double scoops on 1-waffle cone & other in a waffle bowl). Using the coupon under deals in the app (buy one cone, get one 50% off). I was expecting to get 50% off one cone making the $5.29/2= $2.65 off to pay less.  The coupon only took off $1.78 (not sure where that amount came from😠). The deals on the 31st is no longer; therefore, I expect the coupon be more of a deal.  In this pandemic people can use more of a discount.  I felt cheated.",1,VA-JM,2021-02-11 02:43:59,False,Baskin Robbins
18,?? latest update has caused app to crash,"i used to be able to open app and be automatically logged in & my coupons pulled up, but since the update, i open app and it tells me to log in, which i do through FB, but instead of logging me in, it takes me to a screen that says sign up and when i check that i'm 13 or over, it says account already exists...well duuuuh, log me in though FB then, like i always have. Another thing is the B'day club. why ask for my b'day if its going to change the date by 2 or 3 days? Someone PLEASE GET IT TOGETHER.

19,Useless,"This app is completely USELESS!!! You can’t really order anything! I wanted to order a cappuccino blast and a banana split, but guess what?  You can’t order it!! What’s the point of having an app if you can only order pre-packed ice cream and brownies.  So.... let me get this straight, this app lets you order things you can go to the store and pick up, but stuff that takes time to make you still have to go in order and wait?  What’s the point then?  Whoever created this app must have been a genius!! Congrats to them!",1,poopsder,2021-01-29 00:42:42,False,Baskin Robbins
20,A request,So I’m writing this review hoping that the app could have a merge balance option when you have multiple cards. I had a few cards with $2 in them each and merging them would make paying easier rather than opening each one separately.,4,Bdjedjsksnsk,2018-05-22 19:41:16,False,Baskin Robbins
21,Easy to use and configure,"I love Baskin Robins. I use my TMobile gift cards all the time when I get them. There’s only one option I would add. Combine gift cards instead of having to switch through a bunch of gift cards. It would help a lot. 

The app works really well for me. No problems and everything is easy to access.",5,Eric bLyons,2018-09-05 18:49:04,False,Baskin Robbins
22,Worst App I’ve used to date,"This app is just disrespectful. I feel like BR hired a bunch of first year programming students to make this app. Nothing works. I’m always looking at a “loading” screen. App crashes all the time. It’s not worth the hassle to do anything on this card. It makes me not want to visit BR. I don’t understand how because the Dunkin Donuts app is phenomenal. If I didn’t know it before, today I am convinced Baskin Robbins is a failing company with no value over other ice cream shops. What a joke. Go to a local place instead. I’ll bet their “reward system” is better anyways",1,Chillllama,2018-07-10 17:15:28,False,Baskin Robbins
23,Sorry to say :/,"I downloaded this app around Father’s Day and tried to purchase a gift card for my dad. I was charged 5 times for one gift card cuz the app said there was an error message several times I tried to complete the order. Then after several attempts of reaching out to customer service I still have yet to get the money that was over charged back. :/ Bummed I don’t have something better to say about this app, but very disappointed with my experience.",1,Mea C.,2020-07-10 02:57:58,False,Baskin Robbins
24,Needs improvement,I love going to Basking Robbins but i hate this app. I have gift cards on the app but every time i go in store to try and use them they struggle and they apologize and tell me I can’t use it. Not only that but i also can’t merge them so when i was able to use them and it was once i had to individually scan each gift card. This app is such a let down for a growing ice cream shop. If you’re going to give me the option to pay from on my phone you need to make sure it works.,1,Philomenam,2018-05-27 01:46:43,False,Baskin Robbins
25,Worst app I have ever used,"Not only does this app frustrate you just trying to make an account to log in, which by the way you can’t, you are forced to use Facebook to log in... but even once you are in and want to pay, it asks you for a log in again, and there is no way around this one. It’s just a constant loop of asking for a log in name and password.

USELESS APP by a large company like Baskin Robbins. If I could give negative star ratings, this app would deserve it.

26,FREE ICE CREAM? WAIT 24 HOURS,"I thought I was gonna get his app while I was in the store and get a free cone, from what it said on the door that was how in worked. Nope. You have to wait 30 hours for the coupon to deliver. The app is also poorly organized, it looks like a collage. Terrible. Half the coupons there also have a catch, such as $3 off and in tiny words that u can barely read says “minimum $15 purchase”. I’m very dissatisfied and hope they fix their app soon. Because I’m deleting it. What a waste of space!!",1,Basic bish,2018-06-18 01:11:31,False,Baskin Robbins

28,Don’t work,I can’t believe this app has 4 stars when it does work at all. I was able to register but when I tried to order something it takes us straight to find a store after you select one it does NOTHING! it doesn’t even have a next button so you are not able to move forward. I try to make an order online as well and it has the same issue. Very frustrating!,1,DebraSO,2022-01-18 20:38:54,False,Baskin Robbins

30,Got me in trouble!,"My boyfriend wanted ice cream from Baskin Robins. I decided to download this app-which surprisingly downloaded pretty fast. I went to look up the ice cream flavors and topping flavors and the stupid app only listed cakes, novelties, pints, it even listed candles-really candles but not the flavors of ice cream. Seriously, the ice cream flavors were not listed. My boyfriends patience wore thin and he left the room frustrated with me!

31,App is horrible,"Almost every time I use this app, something doesn’t work. It’s usually the login. Today it did not accept my password and when I used the app to change it, the recovery email took me outside the app. For the fun of it, I tried to set my not-working password as my new password but it was not accepted because it was already used by me. Then, after actually creating a new password, the app did not recognize it either.",1,LMG GemLover,2019-08-01 02:35:01,False,Baskin Robbins
32,Needs more improvement,I love Baskin-Robbins but their sometimes don’t work in registers especially gift cards so k have many gift cards giving to me since they know my kids love their ice cream. I wish I can combine the gift cards just like the one from Dunkin’ Donuts. I wish u guys make this option available.

35,Horrible,"As a T-Mobile customer, I have been unable to redeem the codes given to us. Using “forgot my password” just sends a new password for their birthday club but doesn’t help you sign in. As everyone else said, Facebook login probably works but if you can’t get your app working properly I can’t imagine you’d be using my Facebook information responsibly either. I hope T-Mobile drops BR and just gives DD codes until you fix this.",1,Bassichonda96,2018-06-21 22:46:02,False,Baskin Robbins

When I went to use it I could not log into my account.  I reset my password but still could not log in.  It is now a few weeks later and still says error on their end.  So lost my free ice cream.  Well, at least the app did not cost anything hence the 1 star.",1,Kikichan2000,2019-08-06 20:57:48,False,Baskin Robbins
38,Useless app,Not able reload app with gift card for more than two months. Website doesn’t have option to redeem gift card. BR is totally crap app and experience. Better to have other ice creams than these. They never forget to spam you even if you unsubscribe. Why there is no zero or negative rating here. Online order never goes through.

42,Needs A Merge Balance Option,So Baskin Robbins and Dunkin’ Donuts are pretty much the same company. So how come on the DD app you can merge all of your card balances but you can’t do that on the BR app ? It’s such a pain to go to the store and swipe through several cards to pay and start a line of people behind me as the cashier is patiently trying to scan them all. Please fix this and make it just like the DD app and let us finally merge our card balances.,1,Breaktj,2018-09-19 13:44:38,False,Baskin Robbins
43,Could be a lot better,"One annoying thing is you cannot merge balances from different cards stored in the app into one card.

47,Worst Restaurant App Ever,"I’ve never used an app for a store/ restaurant that is so bad. There has to be bots rating this 5 stars because it’s a 2 at best. It’s so difficult to order on and a very strange set up. The designer needs to be fired. Also, it’s very glitchy and doesn’t include the whole menu when you want to order takeout.
