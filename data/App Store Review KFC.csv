0,Madison7015,5,"Since when has KFC had an app?! I feel the need to hop in my cream/tan (it's like the color of a perfectly toasted marshmallow) jeep and get a chicken sandwich and some coleslaw. The app is so clean and so... so... desirable! 
Could it have a kids menu? Yes. Could it give me the option to remove ice from my drink? Yes. Could the developer make it a little more personalized? Like a 'good morning, I hope you get that promotion today' (bc I know the internet knows all my info anyways üôÑ).. yes 
But overall, I give the app 5 stars in general. But for the sake of specificity, I give it 4.765 stars. 
You all should be proud of yourselves, mucho props (it was about time) and my 2021 has definitely gotten better from the discovery of this app and all that is has to offer

1,Tj hhii,1,The app desperately needs work. It‚Äôs missing a lot of menu items. I had assumed they were removed from the menu so ordered different then a then what I actually wanted. So when I got there I seen the actual menu and was disappointed with what I got because everything I wanted was still available. Just not in the app. Also ordered sauces with the app get charged for it. Get up to drive through window they ask did I want any sauces I said no just the ones I ordered with the app. The employees informed me they can‚Äôt actually see what sauces I requested. So if they didn‚Äôt as or I just assumed it was good. I would have paid for sauces and not received them. Disappointing because I act find using apps to order more convenient. Rather then siting at the menu board try to order food and after each item being asked is that all. For real is it so common for people to just say an item and sit silently waiting to be asked if that all. That now it‚Äôs gotten so bad that people can‚Äôt take more then half a second to say the next item before being interrupted with is that all. No I will say and that‚Äôs all at the end of my order thank you very much.,It works kinda,False,2021-06-26 19:40:24,,KFC
2,ponchinator,2,Awful app does not change wait time what so ever I go into kfc EVERY-TIME I end up WAITING AND WAITING AND WAITING either as a customer or a doordasher I get frustrated because as a customer I am going to a fast food place hungry expecting to get my food FAST and I end up waiting 30-45 minutes for a few pieces chicken why would I do that when I can go to any nicer restaurant and dine in and order food and probably wait a shorter amount of time for a whole dine in entree. As a doordasher it‚Äôs beyond frustrating because I am on a roll with good earnings for the day and I am motivated to continue BUT THEN I go to Kfc and everything changes I end up losing my whole momentum just because I decided to accept a doordash order from kfc I end up waiting over 30 minutes!!! Keep in mind in that time I‚Äôve just been waiting I don‚Äôt get paid I get a bad review instead for taking too long because kfc doesn‚Äôt have any chicken ready but somehow it‚Äôs my fault and I can never explain it because it‚Äôs no contact delivery,I would delete it twice if I could,False,2021-10-09 14:36:04,,KFC

4,ThrownAwayAlready,1,"I ordered and fully paid for my food through the KFC app , only to be told when I arrived at the location that: 1) they didn‚Äôt have most of what I ordered on hand, and 2) I would have to call KFC‚Äôs 800 number to cancel the order and get a refund, as the local store has no way of doing that.

So this app basically takes your payment upfront and then messages your order to the local store with no way of the store confirming that they can actually provide what you want at the time you requested. And then you find out after you‚Äôve driven to the restaurant whether or not you will actually get your food, AND whether or not you will have to (like me) sit on hold for 15 minutes to request a refund from their customer service department.
Picking up the phone and calling in your order to the local KFC would give you instant feedback on whether you can get what you want, without paying for food you can‚Äôt get upfront.

5,NMNavarr,1,"I've tried to use this app to order food on three separate occasions, but I've given up and gone in myself every single time. Several options from the menu are missing, including drinks: no root beer, no Dr. Pepper (it's actually available for selection all the way up until I choose my location), etc. even though you can order them all if you go there in-person. This issue seems to extend to the website as well. The meal options that they do offer give you no room for customization. If a meal comes with a medium drink and you want to upgrade to a large, too bad. The only way around it is to order every piece individually, which will cost significantly more than if you bought it as a meal. If there actually is a way to make changes, then it is incredibly well hidden and unintuitive compared to every other fast food app that I've used before.","Missing Menu Items, Terrible Customization",False,2021-11-18 23:55:28,,KFC
