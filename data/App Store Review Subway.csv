You can select all items from the menu and indicate the specific bread, meat, toppings and sauces. I love how you can even indicate whether you want the regular amount or if you‚Äôd rather have more of a topping or less of the amount. You can also add on ‚Äú make it a meal‚Äù or side items individually. It is great that after you make an item you can select it as a favorite and put a name on it. This makes it easier the next time you are ordering for a family you just go to your favorites and you can find all your items already built to suit for each person. Additionally, you automatically earn points toward your reward tokens with later turn into cash rewards toward your purchase. The only downside the the rewards is that they do expire so don‚Äôt forget to use them. Last perk...well you can skip the line of course.

1,2020-12-13 22:54:17,csfrost1986,"Especially compared to the competition (places like Taco Bell, Sonic, Pizza Hut, and Starbucks, which all have excellent apps), I find this app to be buggy and inconvenient. Adding toppings and sauces to subs is more cumbersome than it should be and I usually experience a lag when trying to remove toppings. The options online often don‚Äôt match up with the store. Salt apparently isn‚Äôt an option using the app, although pepper is? Maybe the issues lie with my local Subway‚Äôs inventory, but I also can‚Äôt select chip options that I know they have in store. There‚Äôs no way to specify what kind of fountain drink you want if you add it as a stand-alone item (can only specify if it‚Äôs part of a meal). As a result, I have to use the special request section to correct my order since it isn‚Äôt accurate and even then I just end up having to grab everything myself when I get to the store. Also, ‚ÄòMake it a meal?‚Äô shows up for subs but not for personal pizzas, even though every Subway I‚Äôve ever gone to offers up the option of making my pizza a meal. Had to try adding my credit card about 4 times before it finally saved it (even though I didn‚Äôt change any info  from the first attempt to the last... it was just being buggy). Buggy and slow when trying to remove items from the cart.

I'm running iOS version 12.4.1 on my iPhone. I was impressed when the support person with whom I spoke actually knew how to turn on VoiceOver, and try the app using it with his phone. He was running iOS 13.3, and I heard the app working as it should, getting past the first screen. He also had a coworker try it with iOS 13.3 on an older phone.
So, we arrived at the solution that I would update my iPod Touch, and see if I can get past the first screen with it. When I tried that the next day, sure enough, it did work!
And now, for whatever reason, it's again working on my phone at iOS 12.4.1, too, when the other day, I could double tap until the cows come home, and it wouldn't go anywhere past the initial screen.
MANY THANKS Subway tech support! You've restored some of my faith in app developers and tech support people who actually have an interest in app accessibility!
THANK YOU AGAIN!
The original review text from a few days ago is below, but I consider this issue definitively resolved for the time being!

We had to leave because we could not wait any longer. The employee was fixing customers sandwiches who had just walked in the store instead of fixing our online order that had been placed over 20 minutes before. 

For a refund, we were told by the employee that they could not refund our money and that we had to call customer service. But the employee did not have the customer service number. 

There is also no way to request a refund on the app or anything to troubleshoot should an order go unfulfilled. 

When we finally found a number using Google (because the Subway website does not list a number), we got an automated message saying that app order issues can only be handled by sending a message through the website. Which is ridiculous. 

Perhaps a troubleshooting tab on the app. Or a way to request a refund through the app. Anything but having to go to your website and click through to find the right form. 

We did submit an inquiry on the website. Five days later, no response. And certainly no refund.

1st is why all locations don‚Äôt have the same options on their app as every location has the same ingredients. For example, when I go inside, I order turkey & ham sandwich, but very few locations offer a turkey AND ham sandwich on the app when it‚Äôs doable in the store.

2nd and most frustrating is that every time I order a sandwich, something is wrong. Forgotten lettuce, forgot the cheese, forgot to toast it, forgot bacon, forgot ham, wrong bread (one shop did call me to tell me they were out of the bread I choose, which I liked), forgot the sauces, etc. I think by now I‚Äôve experienced each ingredient missing at least once (minus bread - that‚Äôs a little hard to forget).

That‚Äôs an immediate pain in the behind because then I had to go in and remove everything that I didn‚Äôt like and then add things through the customize menu. It‚Äôd be a lot easier to simply start with the main ingredients (turkey and ham in my case) and then customize from there. I can‚Äôt imagine EVERYONE wants the ingredients you have the sandwich preset up for. Secondly, I had zero success getting the $5 deal listed if I was to order two of the sandwiches.

One of the beautiful things about subway is being able to walk in and customize a sandwich to your exact liking: protein, cheeses, add-ons, and sauces galore. That, unfortunately, is not the case here on the app. There are very few sandwiches to select from and what are available are set and fixed so if, for example, you choose a ham and cheese melt, it is impossible to add, say, turkey or bacon. There is also not a full list of sauces on the app. So you can add basic condiments like Mayo, mustard, oil and vinegar, but the fun ones such as creamy sriracha or southwest (etc) are not featured and available on the app. All in all, this is a big bust for my family.

Earlier versions were clearer, now it‚Äôs a bunch of flowery crap you have to scroll through to order. It‚Äôs also like a game (in a bad way) where you have to be careful what you touch because it will toss in a drink and chips into your order while all you want to do is change one ingredient. The only reason for using an app instead of ordering in person is because it is supposed to be faster and easier. The app in it‚Äôs current state does neither. The Panera app has considerably more options, yet is easier to maneuver through and edit an order.

Changing the size of an order shouldn‚Äôt reset all of the toppings. Instead, the app should make a reasonable assumption and keep all the toppings and just change the size. Second, the application performance could be better. I see the loading screen too often in this app. Perhaps there was a trade-off made to ensure the data is loaded independently for each location.
