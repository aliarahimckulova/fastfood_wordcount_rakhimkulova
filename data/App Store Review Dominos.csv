0,Sarah P Marie xo,I love it!! - babysitter edition,5,False,"Being able to look at the menu and order online makes things so much easier. I babysit 3 kids at a time and when I order pizza it‚Äôs hard to pay attention to them or for whoever I talk to on the phone hear me. The app itself is organized and shows prices and coupons while you look through the menu. The food is also very good if you are one that gets full quickly. There is a huge selection of food to choose from and there is always a good coupon to use (my favorite is the 5.99 deal because the kids can get a pizza with 2 toppings they want. And then I can get either brownies for them or if I want a sandwich or salad instead of pizza I can get them- and it‚Äôs a short price considered what I could pay at other pizza places). Another thing that is beneficial is how I don‚Äôt have to stand by the door guessing the time they will be here. Instead they let me know when they left the store and the store is 10 min away so I know they will be here within 15 min. So I‚Äôll stay by the door for like 5 min instead of the whole 25-30 minutes. The app is very beneficial and helpful. So I def recommend this app, especially for my friends at a party or when babysitting",2020-03-08 17:57:50,Dominos
1,LunarNyaa,Please add garlic options to the app,5,False,"I love the food and the app is a great help but I wish there was an option for pasta/ bread bowls, pizzas, bread knots, wings, etc. to have the options of garlic or no garlic. I rarely get the bread bowls because I have a garlic intolerance I‚Äôm not allergic but it‚Äôs very very painful after eating it. I don‚Äôt like having to place an order only to realize too late I have to call the store and ask them not to. I don‚Äôt normally complain about anything with the food I really love it but it‚Äôs very awkward and inconvenient to have to call just to avoid a mishap. I feel really bad about it because a lot of the people that work at Dominos are really hard workers and the branch we order from are some of the most kindest, hardworking, genuinely care about the customers and take pride in doing things right. A lot of people who work in the food industry do care about their customers or their work of their job and I feel that a lot go under appreciated. Thank you for making the app to make it easier to order and thank you to the workers for all your hard work. Especially during the pandemic.",2021-05-19 00:23:39,Dominos
2,Millenial(s),The purpose of a native iOS app: beat dominos,2,False,"I can imagine a few benefits from skipping out on building. Native app, but, it‚Äôs also all divided by a the cost of doing anything new, so I‚Äôm sure it makes less tsetse for profit people than product people. However, this app is garbage: even if the error codes have the exact same message as on the web (which isn‚Äôt hard for a native app to do). The hierarchy for actions is absurd. When I‚Äôm in the menu, I can‚Äôt see what‚Äôs in my cart, or my order totally until I‚Äôve added an item to the menu or closed the menu. Further, when you modify a pizza (I suppose it‚Äôs possible domino‚Äôs executives only eat the specialty pizzas) the price of the item you‚Äôre about to add to your order isn‚Äôt displayed. If you have 20 cash and want to maximize your pizza toppings, you might be adding something to the cart and removing it till you get it right for a long time, depending on user intelligence towards domino‚Äôs menu pricing. 

Bad app. It got an additional star because everything fit on screen and the branding was consistent with the average-at-best domino‚Äôs website. But that 2 should be compared with the 3 star‚Äôs missing for not valuing the user experience as an outcome of corporate value. 

(FYI, I couldn‚Äôt see the text as I was typing this, Apple that‚Äôs a problem u should look into. iPhone 6s Plus)",2020-09-04 00:56:55,Dominos
3,OctQueen,Imma be honest about it,5,False,"These ppl that made the pizza they be mean whenever you tell them you have it all the way burned order a pasta they talking about we don‚Äôt see you order pasta like dude sometimes your point don‚Äôt even show up on the system n I don‚Äôt care I just want my food cook right. I used to work at dominoes so I know ppl played around in there n the boss would like them then they look at the food n don‚Äôt want to admit they have it burnt 
You ask them to remake it n they get upset. I don‚Äôt know why  they don‚Äôt buy the products, they just make the stuff so we can order. Oh then the system they took money off my card it took me a whole month to get it back n everyone gave me a problem üòï I called up there 
‚ÄúMa‚Äôam I don‚Äôt see you order it didn‚Äôt pop up in the system‚Äù a girl with an attitude n I‚Äôm looking at my bank and I can clearly see they took my money took me an whole month cause they said I had to wait til I can get it back. So they have time where it just bad tbh it would be nice for corporate to actually answer the phone when I called or something they food good just this site in general isn‚Äôt",2019-12-29 21:38:43,Dominos
4,watonman,App needs to be modernized,3,False,"Am only giving this review because I was unable to place a delivery order from my favorite store. Usually I do carry outs but on this occasion I was unable to go out, so I had to use the delivery service. Thinking all was going as planned I calmly placed my order only to later discover some few seconds later my carry out store address on my profile was changed automatically. These seemingly did not sit well with me so I hurriedly tried to change the address back to my favorite stores address, only for me to find out that if you choose to use their (dominos) delivery service, you will automatically assigned the nearest store close to your location, this evidently infuriated me, because I have already gone to the store that was automatically assigned to my profile twice and I was not satisfied with how they make their pizza. Please if any of this app developers should see this, try to ensure you make it possible for people to order from their favorites stores in as much as they can pay for the delivery. The other reason which aided in my decision to award this app three stars is the lack of modern user interface. Am improvement in that area will be greatly appreciated.",2022-03-11 16:29:00,Dominos
5,Camila Camilo,How can pizza be this Good!?,5,False,"I‚Äôll tell you how; You want a delivery driver that‚Äôs willing to battle the unstable elements of blistering winds and sheer cold late at night against terrible drivers that impede their journey to deliver said treasure politely and elegantly at your door without breaking so much as a sweat to save your relationship when your significant other complains there‚Äôs nothing to eat since you couldn‚Äôt get the groceries and all the stores are closed? Yes you do. You DO want the blessings of humanity to ring your doorbell and support your relationship like Atlas holds up the world on his rippling shoulders all the while enjoying the very pizza you ordered in a cozy warm living room while the champions that brought upon a new form of nirvana accept your shillings and tip their cap looking over their shoulder dramatically in the night like Ryan Gosling in ‚ÄòDrive‚Äô; KNOWING FULL WELL that they are the real heroes and live a life of danger and unprecedented hazards that live on the edge like a 1970s action flick with unnecessary explosions because not all heroes wear capes but all heroes have a uniforms.

6,Johngcp,This app is so annoying,2,False,"I can‚Äôt believe a company would make it so hard to give them money. I spent over 30 mins or more trying to place an order on my iPad, where if you go to review your order you can‚Äôt go back and add anything else unless you want what they suggest, or you delete your whole order and start from scratch. That still wouldn‚Äôt have taken so long to place the order tho, but I was using a coupon they had, but my total was coming out way more than it should have. It took me a while to figure out that some crusts and toppings were causing my price to go up because they were more costly ingredients. The problem is no where on the list of ingredients does it let you know which ones cost extra and which don‚Äôt, it‚Äôs just one list of ingredients and if you choose ingredients based on the coupons guidelines and the price comes out to high then you are left confused as you get no information as to why. So after starting from scratch a few times since I can‚Äôt just go back to the main menu, I finally figured out what was raising the price so high. This app needs work, the ceo should try and use it, get to checkout and then try and go back to add something else and he‚Äôd quickly fire whoever made this app.",2020-05-04 05:22:50,Dominos
7,zeroverse,"Great app, only needs minor improvements",5,False,"This app is snappy, easy to use, and highly functional compared to other ‚Äúfast food‚Äù apps. The dev team did a great job. A couple suggestions for improvements: For carside pickups (mandatory in my neck of the woods during Covid), it would be nice if we had the option to have our car‚Äôs details (color, make, model etc) saved. I have to re-enter the details each time...not convenient. Same goes for delivery instructions...let us save them for next time. Rewards: they should be point-based for each dollar spent...not just 10 points for spending any amount over $10 points. $10 order? 10 points. $40 order: 10 points. What‚Äôs the incentive to order more?. If I‚Äôm spending $20, I should get 20 points, not 10. Now, I just create two orders if the pizzas are $11-12 each. Do whatever math you need to, to make rewards make sense, but don‚Äôt incentivize splitting orders up...it‚Äôs inconvenient for us and sometimes confusing for your staff. Also, a visual graph indicating our point standing would be nice.",2020-09-26 01:45:50,Dominos
8,SilasZB,Dominos has outdone themselves,5,False,"Now as I'm sure many of us know, Dominos used to have a rap for being ""cheap and inauthentic"" pizza. As someone who orders Dominos a lot, I agree, it was definitely nothing compared to now. In my past 12 orders, I have received extremely great customer service, expedition of delivery, great deals, and AMAZING food. I regularly tell people to order from them more, no matter what their opinion of what their last experience might've been. Dominos to me, is a leader and example of how a business should progress in the 21st century. Everything that Dominos has done in the recent decade has been a groundbreaking improvement for the company. I only order from Dominos and will continue to until the day I die. I love you Dominos. Thank-you.
Side note: the app is awesome. They keep you 100% updated the entire way through the order and very happy, friendly reminders from the employees when they're on their way and outside.

Update: I've probably made around 40-50 orders in the past year using the app. Absolutely still the best way to get the best pizza!",2017-09-23 05:06:38,Dominos
9,Everfic,No ETA,2,False,"This app is deceptively convenient, it even has an ‚Äúorder tracker.‚Äù That is, until you realize that you have no idea if the location you‚Äôre ordering from is slammed or any sort of indicator of when your order will be ready/delivered (they just tell you when a milestone happens for your order, no timeframe for actually meeting those milestones). I have experienced multiple surprise 3+ hours waits using this app. And if the location you‚Äôre ordering from decides not to answer their phone (either because they‚Äôre just that busy or they don‚Äôt want to deal with what they assume will be an upset customer), like mine did tonight, you‚Äôll have no way to know how bad of a wait you‚Äôre in for without driving over in person (which feels excessive to me). I literally ordered at 7:33pm and it‚Äôs 11:22pm now, zero pizza to show. I don‚Äôt blame the people working there for being understaffed and overbooked, but I do blame the app for not giving an option for warning you if a place is slammed, or just not allowing past a certain number of orders. Even just changing it so that you can see what the milestone etas are could do a better job of stopping people from ordering when they clearly can‚Äôt deliver.",2021-11-22 07:26:43,Dominos
10,more toppings plz,Please more toppings,5,False,Every time we see an ad on TV from Dominos the toppings are amazingly an abundance on the pizza. And when I get my pizza I‚Äôll get maybe a handful of Topping! It‚Äôs pretty sad that you see more cheese than Topping. I know black olives come in a can. They can‚Äôt be that expensive just to throw a half a handful on them be generous! You know we all don‚Äôt just like cheese we want toppings pepperoni bacon sausage black olives onions peppers and etc. I‚Äôve gotten the pepperoni lovers. It looks just like a regular pepperoni pizza! So I feel like I‚Äôve been wasting money just ordering the specialty pizzas. If they don‚Äôt put enough toppings on it to even matter. So I save money by not even bothering to place the orders for the specialties. If you guys please could work on this I‚Äôd greatly appreciate it. I‚Äôve ordered pizzas throughout the years here and it‚Äôs only been a handful where they‚Äôve been really good. I‚Äôm not a picky person but when your boyfriend says don‚Äôt go back there. Did their pizza is not worth the price. It‚Äôs not a good sign when you order five pizzas in the more.,2019-11-22 22:40:32,Dominos
11,Jacob0032,Greatest Service in a long time!,5,False,"We‚Äôve lived in the Lent‚Äôs area of Portland Oregon for the better part of about 40 years now. We‚Äôve ordered Dominos about once a month for the majority of the past about 10 years. Our home store is the one near Eastport Plaza. Until recently there‚Äôs always seemed to have been something wrong with our order; wrong order, wrong toppings, items missing (like bread bites or soda.) we‚Äôre ordering again tonight because the last couple of months we‚Äôve had incredibly great experiences! Nothing has been wrong and everything has been even better great! (I should also mention this is not only for delivery, but occasional carry out as well) Not sure if there‚Äôs a new manager, or a different crew (I do notice there‚Äôs usually someone training on something, so I‚Äôm guessing there may be a bit of quick turnover as is the case with most fast food type stores) Anyway! Whosever running things for the better there please keep on doing what you‚Äôre doing because it‚Äôs definitely working! Thanks",2018-07-01 05:40:13,Dominos
12,The Stereophonic Oddity,Latest Version Never Credits Reward Points,1,False,"I order a A LOT of Domino‚Äôs, and part of the reason I‚Äôve remained loyal has been the rewards. With one of these recent updates however it has stopped crediting me entirely. I noticed last week that my reward points were lower than expected, but now after my most recent order and reviewing the orders I received credit for there are multiple missing. Furthermore there is no way to recover the rewards number & earn credit for these previous orders unless I have the physical box the pizza came in still in the fridge or trash, because I order & pay through the app, and I‚Äôm not emailed a rewards number with my receipt because I‚Äôm supposed to be signed-up and receiving those credits automatically. Luckily I was able to recover credit for one order this way, but the others appear to be irredeemable and there‚Äôs nowhere to look for more info. I‚Äôm very upset and disappointed, because I‚Äôve ordered Domino‚Äôs at least once a week for the last 5 years and  with my daughter and I order many many pizzas for the summer camp I manage every year. Having this happen multiple times over the last 4 weeks shows it‚Äôs systemic- whether a glitch or not-  and Dominos is going to lose my business going forward.",2020-02-01 00:40:40,Dominos

I‚Äôm just glad they are in my delivery zone!!!! Hahahahah! P.S. tip ur drivers people. These guys u trust with ur food. So they trust u will help them make minimum wage with tips.

14,a barracks marine,Used to be good,4,False,"My last two deliveries was absolutely horrible. The app would say this person has left the store at this time but I wouldn‚Äôt get
My pizzas until an hour later when it‚Äôs in between warm and cold. Three months ago was the worst where it took them 3 hours to get my pizzas delivered in two separate deliveries...I don‚Äôt know why I couldn‚Äôt get them in one delivery when I only put in one order. On that note one of the pizzas was wrong. I complained only to feel like I was being shrugged off to an excuse of ‚Äú we‚Äôre really busy on saturdays‚Äù. If that is so then hire some more people to work Saturday‚Äôs and give me my pizza in a timely manner! On top of that not all pizzas are consistent with one another in taste and quality. The first time I had break sticks here, it was absolutely amazing! Then the last two times it was mediocre so I never get them anymore. Sometimes there‚Äôs just enough sauce which is amazing and then other times the sauce is overflowing the pizza as if I ordered extra extra sauce and then there are times where I have to question myself whether or not they forgot the sauce.",2017-10-31 03:19:32,Dominos
15,Hartdoc,The Pizza Is Suddenly Really Good,5,False,"I have not ordered Domino‚Äôs for years because the product was no better than grocery store frozen pizza. I needed a pepperoni pizza for kids, and I decided to order one of the new pan pizzas for me. When I picked up the pizzas and opened the first box, I was so surprised by the appearance of the product. It was smoking hot, the pepperoni was crisp and sizzling, and the hand tossed crust was blistered, crackly and perfectly, very slightly, charred. It was magnificent! 

I opened my pan pizza (sausage, jalape√±os, diced tomatoes, and onions). It was equally fantastic. A bit of the cheese, just the right amount, was all the way to the edges of the crust creating that yummy, chewy, crispy edge that is so addictive. 

Dominoes, I salute you. You figured out pizza is supposed to be amazing, and that is what you are selling now.  I am back; I‚Äôm a Dominoes customer and even a fan now. If you have not tried Dominoes lately, roll the dice. You can afford six dollars. That‚Äôs all it takes (with the coupon) to get a pizza. No other pizza company is providing the value Dominoes does at the moment.",2018-12-21 15:49:44,Dominos
16,brightcupofsunshine,Double stars,5,False,"I was a customer years ago and the pizza quality and service was awful. Within the past two years of using this app, Domino‚Äôs has gained our family‚Äôs loyalty. We order weekly from them and sometimes when the weather is terrible. This app makes this working mom‚Äôs life so much easier. I can order from work, and not have to worry if they got the food or not. The app alerts you every step of the way in the ordering to the delivery. I can even order for a set delivery time to my office for our lunch meetings. If I am out of town and my family members need to order food they can just log on and pull up a previous order. 
The drivers are always on time and know how to navigate my family‚Äôs wild country driveway. They are awesome! The pizza, deserts, subs, and wings are always perfect.

I keep repeating at least three times my order and getting a great deal. She tells me no what did I want I tell her my Oder again and tell her I don‚Äôt want to pay anymore than 25 for my meal because my coupons totaled that. So she tells me just a medium one topping pizza will be 25 dollars I was going to order it but I said okay let me hang up cause she is really trying to milk me out of more money. I hang up go back to the app and try again and I get everything I initially wanted for geuss what ...24 dollars.

18,Rad drawer,"Good App, Some Complains",4,False,"This is easily one of the most well coded ordering apps I‚Äôve seen on the App Store, everything is fluid and works well. It has an intuitive interface and is easy to use, my grandmother could probably use this without any trouble. However, there are a few things to be said about the tracker and gift card application. When I tried to checkout using my gift card, after verifying several times that the information I inputted was correct, the system would spit out an error that there was something wrong with my card. After doing 5-6 captchas I finally got it to work, and I was sent to complete my order. However after that, the pizza tracker was behaving rather erroneously, it would jump around and even move backwards from Delivery to Quality Check, this happened several times. Other then those two rather minor issues though, I had a very positive experience with this app! I‚Äôd recommend to anyone ordering from dominoes on mobile, very nice to use.

The guy on the phone was rude about it and didn‚Äôt even offer an a apology. I order from dominoes a lot when I‚Äôm at home but I can tell you I won‚Äôt order from this location again. Absolutely no customer service or even a offer for assistance, and no points for my order on top of it all.  I am so so so very disappointed in this. It has really darkened my view of dominoes as a company not just this particular store.  I value customer service and friendliness as much if not more then the quality of the food. 

I really hope that upper management has the opportunity to review this, as a former member of a NPC management team I know only too well how quickly business and customers can slip away when not being valued and appreciated.

20,Fifi & Lissa,Ordering experience,5,False,We are here on vacation and my grandkids wanted pizza. So I looked up the number to Dominos and I was moved 3 times to 2 different stores. I finally was upset after being moved around for 45 minutes. Spoke to a VERT RUDE worker who called herself a manager named Jessica. If she worked for me I would have to let her go as she didn‚Äôt care if I got pizza for my family. I then ask for her manager and was told very worker there was a manager except drivers. I was very upset because she told me she couldn‚Äôt and wouldn‚Äôt help me place my order. I needed to order online so they would know who‚Äôs store delivers to the hotel we are staying at. I own a business for 31 years and is a delivery company I would never speak or allow any of my workers to speak to my customers the way Jessica spoke to me. I will call her owner of that store tomorrow and have a few words with Manny as she told me that was her manager.

21,JWCG72,Solid App,4,False,"Pretty good app, I‚Äôve been eating domino‚Äôs for years in large part due to two reasons. 1. The pizza is actually pretty good for a mass chain. Lets face it, chain pizza is an abomination. Dominos has mostly avoided the bland taste and texture of the competitors since they reworked things back around 2010 IIRC about the date. A new CEO came to the helm as well I think.  2. This app. I started using it a number of years back and was quite pleasantly surprised at how good it worked for customization, coupons, tracking and payment. Most of the competition still doesnt have apps as good so kudos on that. Dominos must really be glad for this pre existing infrastructure when this pandemic hit. The app almost feels like it was made for just such a reality. I love that I can order a pie, have it contactless placed on my porch, grab it and reheat it for safety for a min or two and have a tasty meal like the pre zombie apocalypse days. My only app gripe is the ios version loses CC info if you double check your order but other than that I love it.",2021-02-04 03:37:00,Dominos

After the delivery person left we noticed that one of the pies wasn‚Äôt the right crust (wasn‚Äôt thin crust) We called and they read the order back saying that only one of them was ordered with thin crust. We checked the app that we ordered it on and sure enough, THEY were correct. In spite of it being our mistake (we forgot to add thin crust) they immediately put the manager on the phone and he told us ‚Äúno problem, we will send another pizza out with thin crust at no charge!!‚Äù We told him that it was ok and not to go to any trouble... we will eat the pie because it was our mistake.

You have to use your card then they make you sign the receipt. It makes since except we don‚Äôt have to sign recipts for any other delivery app (ubereats, DoorDash, etc). I think I had one who placed our pizza on a stand on the ground then rang the bell we opened the door they were on the way to the car. One placed it straight on the ground and stood back. The others handed it to us (not contactless at all) one even handed me a card for his lawn care business. Some came with mask some did not.

25,Mommy 5+,Made to order cut crazy,5,False,Made to order pizza but cut uneven. I received my last pizza with both big slices and baby sized slices. How can you share a pizza cut like that when most people in your family will grab the biggest slices? You know exactly how I feel because either you are the person who wants the biggest slices or you have at least once got stuck with the smallest slice in the box. If I were a secret pizza shopper points would have definitely been taken off for my last pizza. It‚Äôs not rocket science literally cut it in half one way and then half the other way and all that is left is cutting those 4 slices in half again. The only explanation for this is the employee manning the oven is in too much of a rush. A great pizza is a work of art so also please stop dumping the pineapple just in one spot on the pizza- you‚Äôre driving my OCD crazy.

26,Megacycle90381,"Easy to order, but has other problems",3,False,"The app is really easy to use when looking at menu items and getting what you want in the cart. Paying is a different story. It took me three times to add my credit card information before the app accepted it. Kept getting a message that I had no payment method chosen. And, there is no way to add a tip to the total. Message says to add a tip when the driver gets my signature. ??? This is supposed to be a contactless delivery, so this makes no sense! My other pet peeve is that the app always asks me to re-enter my password. I get that this is a security measure, but why does the app not allow for fingerprint or facial recognition instead of making me go find my password and type it in? The font is also TOO LARGE, and the app will only operate in landscape mode, so this means that scrolling through rewards history gets cut off at the bottom of the screen. I would really like to know if the programmers ever use their own app. If they did, these problems would have been fixed by now.",2020-09-09 22:57:58,Dominos

I can only say an issue I have with this is with the delivery update. It‚Äôs not as accurate as I‚Äôd hope it would be for the Dominos Tracker and that‚Äôs a bit of a let down. The last two times, I was waiting for my pizza and got no notification but checked to see if I could see the driver coming because it said my pizza would be arriving in 10 minutes but it was already there.

I don‚Äôt know how long it was outside for. And then 10 minutes later, I got the notification that my pizza had been delivered - this was while I was already eating it. So I‚Äôm a bit more vigilant about my orders but the updates weren‚Äôt accurate which is bothersome.",2020-06-13 21:54:45,Dominos

Second, I was in the store the last time I ordered and waited for my meal.  It was incredibly busy.  The owner or manager was there working right along with his employees.  It was impressive to see him keep an eye on every moving piece and help those that were struggling.  I noticed that he moved a few people around to different stations, so I was assuming he really knows his employees and what they do well.  The drivers would come in for more orders and he was making sure everything was going well for them. The store had a handful waiting, and he‚Äôd keep having his workers check for our order.  He was also motivating them to keep moving.  He said to them ‚Äúif you stop moving or slow down, we are going to get way behind.‚Äù  He was so nice but yet being great at keeping them on pace.

Well you guys were out of the two liters but the girl brought me 3 of the 20 ounce bottles and I think that was AWESOME. She wins a gold star!  In fact because you guys were capable of making the substitution I have decided to delete those other guys app off my phone. I hate getting stuck eating pizza with plain water or having to go out and buy soda because that totally defeats the purpose of having food delivered.

Then when you arrive to pickup they‚Äôll tell you it‚Äôll be ready in 10. You‚Äôll wait 20 they‚Äôll finally figure out your pizza is across town. You‚Äôll reorder and pay a second time at the Carryout location and you‚Äôll call the store across town to try to cancel your wrong order.

31,Azrael Park,Great pizza and flawless app functionality,5,False,"I applaud Dominos for their various creative methods of gaining ground in the real estate of pizza delivery in   ways that are innovative and based on classic customer service. I'm glad their app delivers these features in a clear and accessible layout without hype or confusing technical issues.

They let you earn free points for pizza you buy from anyone (direct approach to market research rewards). 

They throw up 'pizza hotspots' for deliveries because now a days people aren't always stationary.

They insure carry out orders against just about anything.

The Domino's Tracker, which is a trademarked progress bar for your pizza order, gives you realtime info that helps to know that you're being taken care of. 

And I learned all the above while placing an order. 

The app is quick to use and does have lots of 'save this...' checkboxes for your orders, locations, etc. which are, at first a little visually overwhelming but is well explained and makes a ton a sense to save time. 

I don't keep many restaurant apps on my phone because they usually abuse the few bucks they save you to see you as a spam bucket, but the dominos app has been great. 

The only feature I feel is missing is a rough ETA on the final Tracker page - however I'm sure some people get too edgy about the exact time. The estimated time is shown at the final ordering screen.

Keep up the great dev work!",2019-05-02 02:09:29,Dominos

Second, the app used to show the amount saved at checkout. This was great because you could see the savings totaled up, right next to the bill. When Domino‚Äôs still had the  coupon for $5 on 1-topping medium pizzas and wings, I could save almost 50%. It seems that the current programming registers which items were discounted by marking the item price in red. Therefore, the total is the discounted price.

51,Devontey Lee,AVG But time to be more inventive,4,False,Pretty good experience. Rewards is good but a modification to it like double the rewards during football Sunday would amp the sales up. Person who continue to order during Football days usually buy a decent amount of pizza. Being rewarded double or an extra for a purchase limit ie($25 or more) during Sunday should give you an extra 10points or something. To be honest if Pizza Hut delivered in my area it would be tough competition being that they have the same deal. If you want to demolish Pizza Hut into the ground then you have to adapt to the changing factors like they did. They seem that Dominoes was getting more order due to a dollar difference in their pizza deal from 6.99 for each product of select items to dominoes deal of 5.99.

She noticed my daughter and complimented her behavior once and afterward my daughter just came to love her, we both do and live the store. We won‚Äôt get pizza anywhere else. 

An example of the extra effort she puts into things is like for my daughter‚Äôs birthday I ordered I guess around 20 pizzas. When we got to the party every single box had a special birthday wish to my daughter. All unique and all extremely thoughtful. 

I can‚Äôt say enough good things and I‚Äôd like to be clear that we only came to know her through doing business at this store so it‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre friends outside the store or neighbors.

Another example is once I made a comment that my daughter didn‚Äôt feel well and when we got home there was a special message for my daughter again from Joanie.

She‚Äôs the best and deserves far more accolades than I could ever write here.

Please treat her well and commend her and her store!

Thank you,
Louie & Irelyn Conner (daddy & daughter)",2018-12-19 22:32:08,Dominos
55,MamaGr,The food is good...but the app is awful,1,False,"This app makes no sense. They made it to be dynamic and nice to look at, but in doing so, they circumvented their primary goal of making it easy to order their food. I found many examples of this in the 10 minutes it took to order a pizza - the coupons slide across the screen with no warning, the text is far too small and has poor contrast (so you can‚Äôt read it), the lists of toppings should be visible at all times (like on a normal paper menu) without having to scroll, the sauces add-ons for the breadsticks and wings are not set against a contrasting background (so you can‚Äôt see them), the sub menus are infuriating... I could go on and on. Then when I was finally ready to check out, I entered my card info and could not click the ‚Äòcontinue‚Äô button! By the end of my app experience, I was so hungry that I just clicked cash because I honestly just wanted to be finished with this app.

Maybe the real purpose of the app is to make you so frustrated that you want to use your phone to call and talk to an actual person...",2019-08-13 02:41:47,Dominos

Food is always delicious. Drivers always friendly. Almost always super quick. The app is great. Super easy to navigate and use. Never have had any network issues or anything of that sort. Love the different features that make ordering online easy and efficient. Not to mention just feeling comfortable with the fact that you know you‚Äôre getting what you paid for, having it delivered by a friendly and well kept/ clean person, it will be quick, and the most important, knowing that in the rare occasion that there is a mistake, you will be taken care of no questions asked.

57,Mel Mae,Dominos Delivery,2,False,"For the last few years, on an almost weekly basis, I‚Äôve ordered pizza delivery from Dominos for the family. Each time I pay an additional $1.50 for ranch dressing PACKETS. I buy the packets over the cups, paying the extra $1.00 fee for each, because they are Ken‚Äôs ranch dressing, which everyone prefers. This worked fine while I lived in Dallas. However, since moving to Fort Lauderdale, I‚Äôve received the packets maybe twice. Each time the driver apologizes for the mistake, tells me the packets ‚Äúare for salads,‚Äù or offers to return to the store and deliver later (once the pizza is cold and/or already eaten). Occasionally, they‚Äôll offer to refund my money, which NEVER happens. I‚Äôve spent several hours on the phone waiting to speak to a manager about this issue and even filed formal complaints with corporate to no avail. I estimate Dominos has stolen over $50 of my hard earned money by not delivering my order correctly or refunding my undelivered items.

The first request I have is that you add Apple Pay support to the app. I am not going to save my credit card info with every merchant with whom I make a purchase (including Domino‚Äôs), and it‚Äôs inconvenient to have to type it every time. Plus, Apple Pay is more secure. If not this, then please add the ability to auto-fill my credit card information that‚Äôs saved in Safari (iCloud Keychain).

Next, the app should have configurable notification settings. I enabled notifications so that I can be notified about orders I place. The app subsequently sent me spam notifications about deals they have. Please add granular controls so we can disable notifications about specific things like deals. I had to disable notifications completely in the meantime.",2017-11-19 22:11:05,Dominos
61,Kaitlin_Sparks,App and the Crossroads TX store,5,False,"This app is great! If it be that I‚Äôm using it on my iPhone, iPad or getting updates via my Apple Watch. I love the flexibility and functionality of being to just reorder what I order last time and how my rewards are always suggested.

However even though you have a great app your amazing store team at the Crossroads TX location is why we keep coming back. They know my family and I by first name, they pull the pizza off the shelf and having it waiting as we walk-in the door and they always check to make sure our pizza is right. There was one time where the pizza wasn‚Äôt to par and they already had it re-made and it was coming out of the oven as we were walking in.

I never felt lost in the app, even if the coupons are a bit harder to look up than they need to be. However, like everything Dominoes does, it can be a bit finicky at times when your password ceases to work (happened on computer and app login twice now) or your points magically vanish for a few minutes at a time. I will say that these issues are largely on the server side rather than the app side, and have not caused any significant problems since my points have always been logged regardless of any lookup issues. Overall I give it 4/5 because issues did happen, but I never felt like it was the apps fault. (For example my VPN was giving it problems till I switched servers so my issues may have been there)",2021-12-04 06:24:19,Dominos
63,Groovy gravy,Useless.,1,False,"The app is fine. The pizza is decent, but the service is pathetic. I will no longer order from a place that is unable to read simple instructions. They charge you for sauces that they never bring even though they should be double checking their orders before the driver takes off for delivery. I even write in the special notes section ‚Äúdouble check the order for accuracy‚Äú. The manager says it‚Äôs the driver‚Äôs responsibility to double check the order and the driver claims it‚Äôs the cashier‚Äôs responsibility to double check the order, but all I know is that I‚Äôm the customer and it‚Äôs not my responsibility to make sure they got my order correct.  
I‚Äôm deleting the app because I‚Äôm no longer spending money with these morons that cannot follow simple instructions.
Collecting money on an order that was not for filled is basically theft. The support they give to the NFL is also another fine reason I‚Äôm looking forward to no longer spending any money with them, if you don‚Äôt like this country get the out and go wherever you think is better.",2017-11-28 23:03:02,Dominos
64,Greenvino,A few frustrating glitches,3,False,"Editing my order took me back to the ingredients list and it wasn‚Äôt possible to scroll all the way through the non-meat items.

I couldn‚Äôt make any choices from the ingredients list below the place where it was stuck. Had to delete and restart the pizza. Also, I was prompted on the order page to re-enter the payment info I had just entered on the previous screen while I looked for a place to tip the delivery person (which I never found). Also it‚Äôs just a bit too slow. The slightest tweak to a topping leads the app to spend 5 to 10 seconds recalibrating or recalculating. That adds up when you‚Äôre deciding exactly which toppings you want it‚Äôs just too slow.",2021-12-20 02:31:38,Dominos
65,Trindalas,Pretty good. Quite handy.,4,False,"Since the tip feature was put back in I added a star back since last time I rated.

The app is quite handy for ordering pizzas, however there are a couple things I would very much like to see changed. Please stop making use do captchas with gift cards. It makes no logical sense. Even if it‚Äôs a robot paying for the pizza, it‚Äôs still being PAID for. Those things are super annoying. Also it would be nice to save the gift card to the account so we don‚Äôt need to type it in each time. Lastly, please save whether I am getting delivery or pickup, or ask me each time when I choose reorder. I‚Äôve accidentally checked out without changing it a couple times and didn‚Äôt realize it till the store called to see if I was coming. I sometimes forget it doesn‚Äôt remember my choice for that.

Other than that I like the app when I get my pizza cravings :)",2020-03-02 06:24:46,Dominos
66,LidlBob,Love it but,4,False,"I love this app, and dominos, and especially my local dominos. Easy ordering, A+. Two things would be super helpful, though. It would be nice to be able to see the price of items before you add them, and as you go, like how much am I raising the price of this pizza by adding additional toppings. The biggest problem is there doesn‚Äôt seem to be any option to add a tip when you pay with a card, not at checkout, nor on a receipt when the pizza arrives. I‚Äôm sure this issue leaves a lot of drivers tipless, and that is a massive bummer. If I didn‚Äôt think about this, and it was one of the many days I don‚Äôt have any cash on me, idk I‚Äôd feel awful and have to offer my pal some candy, a back rub, something. Y‚Äôall don‚Äôt want me down at the store trying to insist they let me help mop. Too many people don‚Äôt tip properly as it is.

67,adog123,Hidden charges,1,False,"While this app overall works well there is one thing I take serious with.  It is the hidden surcharges for various toppings, sauces, crusts etc. When using a coupon there is no way to see what choices are causing the charge of the pizza to be more then the special price. You are surprised with the extra charges in your cart and then no way of knowing what choice caused the extra charges. I have played extensively with this, adding and removing toppings to try and discover by process of elimination which choices are causing the surcharges and have found nothing is consistent. I can have similar toppings on two different pizzas and one will have a surcharge and the other will not. It feels like to me they are hiding these extra charges as a way to unethically increase the price of their pizzas beyond the special price.   Also, they should add Apple Pay and a payment choice for convenience.  I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôll continue to use this app unless they decide to change their ways which means my business will be going to their competitors.",2019-12-22 01:05:27,Dominos
68,eeeeeeee-money,Was a good app until now.,3,False,"I have been using this app for years now. I tried placing an order online using a debit card with sufficient funds and when I tried to finalize everything told me that there was an error. So I was like ‚Äúok maybe I didn‚Äôt add enough money to my card‚Äù but that wasn‚Äôt the case. After it told me that there was a card error the only option to click next was ‚ÄúOkay‚Äù. So I tried to re-order and use my debit card once more, and it still said it failed. At this point I figured it was something to do with my bank, maybe a bill hit me at a coincidental time. But nope, I just see that I was billed twice and over $40 had been taken out of my account. 

I called my bank to try to file a dispute. When I had told her the situation she told me that she was only seeing one transaction bounce back, however she did see the one failed attempt go through. 
After she told me that and I had filed the one claim I called my local Domino‚Äôs to see if they had received the money and or my order. They told me they haven‚Äôt received either. 

This has been my only issue with this app, I have had no other complaints or disappointments up until now. I would recommend adding a feature that says ‚ÄúPlease do not try to pay again, for it might make a duplicate charge‚Äù like I know most apps do.

69,3R1CN45H,Not CONTACTLESS because of his first issue I have found using iPadOS version of Domino‚Äôs app,1,False,"There‚Äôs no where to add tip at checkout when using iPadOS version when paying with card
Can it still be called ‚Äúcontactless‚Äù when you have to answer the door because they can‚Äôt just put whatever they want as tip and certainly wouldn‚Äôt just accept no tip. Who wouldn‚Äôt knock for that? But then they hand you your pizza. Tried calling the store to just go ahead and tell them but being on hold gets old (no pun intended) and so does having to explain every time ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm not placing an order‚Äù and why there was no tip.
Obviously, I could just be seeing where to enter the tip but even then it should only be in one place at checkout.
Whichever scenario it may be, even though a small oversight, is still an issue that should be addressed.

<<<I‚Äôm done using the app until that one is fixed.>>>

Also, there‚Äôs no way to add special instructions without tricking the system with a work around.
The only way to get a well done pizza when ordering via the iPadOS version of the app is by first, using a non-iPadOS version of the app that does have special instructions to create an easy order where you had the option for well done selected and then, back on the iPadOS version, selecting your easy order.
After that, it‚Äôs there miraculously.

We also love the sandwiches and of course the bread twists. I really like how easy the app makes ordering. The text alert and call reminder to let me know the driver is on their way is very helpful as our home is hard to spot from the street. This way we can know when to look for the driver in case we need to flag them down and I am not alarmed by an unexpected knock at my door, especially if I am not feeling well and a kid has to answer.

The UI could use some work though, and the app often forgets my login details after new versions get downloaded.

I think the ordering process in the app is the minimum of what I expect. I think improvements can be made which would greatly increase my satis-app-tion.

1) A visual representation of my pizza would be nice. I like how Subway's recent app update presents my subs and lets me adjust toppings and the like.

2) An AppleTV app would be awesome so I can order using my Siri Remote and get notifications on my watch, phone, tablet and laptop at the various stages of my order.

3) It would be great to see some details on my pizza delivery person, similar to how Uber gives me details I can confirm with my Uber driver.

4) Some iOS specific touches would be nice. Swipe to remove an expired card for example‚Ä¶ 3D Touch to see ingredients on a pizza before I tap six times to order the damned thing‚Ä¶ Even an Easy Order button in the iOS dashboard (with weather and news) to let me order my Easy Order with one touch.

One other thing that frustrates me is that when you order something that comes with a dipping sauce, they only give you a few preselected options to choose from. Like I can‚Äôt order plain wings and get the garlic dipping sauce with it (so good by the way!).

30 years ago I would have had to pick up my rotary phone and call in to Dominos be put on hold for 10-15 minutes (while they helped other callers), then place my order from a paper menu that I had on my fridge.  The one thing that I do miss from back then is the guaranteed 30 minute delivery.  Oh well, life goes on.  This review took longer than ordering and paying for my pizza.  Hopefully my pizza is out for delivery now ;-)",2019-11-13 00:55:24,Dominos
84,Vicryn,Account compromised,2,False,I‚Äôve had this app in my phone for years and I have not had a problem until recently. Someone was able to gain access to my account and place two different orders to two different states. Initially when I was contacted by the bank to determine if this was fraudulent activity I thought that my number credit card number had somehow gotten out. It wasn‚Äôt until a couple of days later when checking my email I came across the two order confirmations from Dominos at that point I realized that my card number had been compromised from this app. My email address is linked to it. I don‚Äôt plan on using this app again due to the stress it caused (having to visit the bank in the middle of a pandemic to get a replacement card). In the future I will place all of my orders over the phone and pay with cash. It‚Äôs a shame because the app is really helpful and easy to use.,2020-04-23 15:39:56,Dominos
85,HevnzHere,Loved it at first but for months it hasn‚Äôt worked,2,False,"When I first install this app it was everything!  I was able to order with ease, collect points and know when my order was being made and delivered but the past few months I have tried to use it and it has not worked.  I get all the way to the part where I‚Äôm supposed to pay and there‚Äôs always an issue and it‚Äôs not my phone nor is it my card because I‚Äôve tried on multiple phones and different payment methods and I always end up having to call the store to place my order.  I‚Äôve even called several numbers that could not tell me anything about the problem with the app because I can only use my free pizzas on the App which is BAD if the app is not working! Please fix this. I have even uninstalled and reinstalled hoping that would work. FYI- using an iPhone as I always have been even when it worked properly.",2021-06-08 19:08:15,Dominos
86,HarryScottWood,Vaccine/Mask Mandate,1,False,"Dominos sounds like communism especially with the disclaimer they prompt with when doing a store pick up. They mandate that if you‚Äôre not fully vaccinated then you need to wear a cloth mask such as a bandana, face covering, scarf, etc. for the safety of their staff. Unless you‚Äôre ‚Äúfully vaccinated‚Äù which is defined as having two jabs of Maderna or Pfizer or one jab of J&J. This is a load of crap. Cloth masks obviously don‚Äôt offer any protection from airborne particulates and the vaccine doesn‚Äôt protect anyone from contracting COVID. It‚Äôs all about power and control and not science. Good job Domino‚Äôs you stupid communists I didn‚Äôt think a pizza parlor would work for China and big pharma but there you are not giving a crap about individual freedoms. I‚Äôd like to know if the CEO/president is actually masked up and vaccinated, and if their antibodies are actually protecting him/her/they/them/commie from the virus. What a lunatic.

87,Miss_Creant,Best restaurant app!,5,False,"It is so easy to select your items and place your order.  You can save your previous orders so that you can re-order them with just a mouse click or two, even applying the coupons you used in the past.  The real time tracker is a great idea, but doesn't always seem that accurate. It would be neat to see something more real time visual like a GPS tracker that shows where the driver is on a map like Uber does.  I didn't used to eat Dominos pizza, but they made it so easy to order that I order every week now. I also really like their rewards program.  The app tracks that too so you don't have to wonder how many points you have and then have to log into a different app. And also reminds you when you have free pizzas, which is really cool.",2018-02-12 03:29:36,Dominos
88,ColinRT,Thin Crust & GF Crust almost always burned,3,False,"Have had multiple attempts to get an burn free pizza that isn‚Äôt a hand tossed or pan pizza. We actually got a credit once for a replacement order. Then they still burned it again. This is specifically the store in Greensboro, NC on Fleming Road. We keep ordering as some only get 1/8th burned vs the whole pie. But after the fourth order of completely burned gluten free pizza, we will not order again. Ever. This attempt tonight will be our last attempt to try tonight with a thin crust. The store owner was nice the first time. Told us to mark ‚Äúlight cook‚Äù on the thin and GF pizzas. But there is no place to mark light cook. It has normal cook, dark cook. No light cook anywhere on the app. We‚Äôve given up. We don‚Äôt buy again from this store as it is only and always THIS particular Domino‚Äôs pizza. You‚Äôd think if they‚Äôd see thinner crust and a gf crust, they are both thin and thus need to be checked on prior to a regular pizza.",2019-10-20 20:17:07,Dominos
89,An appreciative customer,GREAT SERVICE,5,False,"I stopped at this store today and asked what the specials were for the day.  A very nice and professional woman by the name of Victoria explained the options of the day.  When I started to place the order, it indicated that for that special it had to be placed online.  So, I downloaded the dominos app and Victoria helped me navigate to save time and since I had never used the app before.  I can easily say that it is due to employees like Victoria, that an impression of dominos results in a positive or negative experience.  It is the way you are treated with any business, that makes a positive or negative impression of the name.  I will definitely be back often, due to the professional and courteous manner that Victoria treated me.  I hope dominos recognizes the value they have in such a dedicated employee as Victoria.",2019-05-20 22:00:54,Dominos
90,Fenderstratguy,USEFUL AND HELPFUL APP!!,5,False,"We aren‚Äôt rating the pizza here. 
This review is for the app.  I find it very useful, and I use it equally well from iphone or PC.  I really like two of the features:
1) ORDER HISTORY - The app keeps a recent order history and lets you resubmit a previous order with the same menu options and payment info.  We happen to like our custom orders, so we tend to repeat the identical order time after time.  For us, this app is a big timesaver ....brilliant!  Without getting out of my chair I placed our usual 2-pizza carryout order in about two minutes. 

2) TRACKER - This app shows the status of your food order.  Is it ready for pickup? Is it going to be awhile yet?  Helps me get to the carryout counter usually right about the time my pies are coming out of the oven.",2019-09-22 04:18:39,Dominos
91,backwheelman,It‚Äôs fair,3,False,"So I been using this app for a very long time and honestly dislike the small fact that you can‚Äôt make a comment about your order for example I just ordered 3 pizza 3 garlic butter dips,bread bites and a 2 letter of coke it was about 40 buck so it was a great deal till I got ranch instead of garlic butter dip for my bread, I didn‚Äôt get my soda at and to top it off one of my pizzas were cold and while one was kinda warm and the other was oddly extremely hot and that would be undesirable if I was a far distance away but google maps say it‚Äôs a 3 minute drive from the dominos I was thinking darn I gave the guy a tip  to lol next but honestly it‚Äôs quite often a problem where I‚Äôm told oh sorry I forgot you soda (and or)dipping sauce and etc maybe I‚Äôm just ordering from the wrong pizza place I mean Rocky‚Äôs pizza joint is just down the street it‚Äôs a bit more pricey but I guess the story is you get what you pay for",2019-04-07 02:20:45,Dominos

I downloaded the app today and ordered the 3 topping $7.99 Pizza and found it very easy to make a 1/2 & 1/2 Pizza that my wife and love and nicked named it after our names. Dominos for low cost Pizza is our first choice. At check we paid $2.00 more for some premium toppings we selected, but that was fine.  Tip to see the advertised specials in the app, select add coupon and then you can select the special and create your Pizza.  While I wrote this review, I have been sent two status messages. Got to go and get that pie.",2019-05-22 02:20:53,Dominos

94,JubrDog,Amazing App!,5,False,"This app takes away all my issues that revolve around ordering from Dominoes via web ‚Äî the delivery fee is factored into the price before checkout so I feel as though the app is more honest with the information in regards to what the customer is required to pay. I love the app functionality as far as how it fills out coupons and compiles orders. However I wish the app was a little more immersive ‚Äî if there were basic animations or a more dynamic flow of the elements on screen I would probably feel more compelled to use the app since it would be more rewarding to interact with the interface. 

Overall though it‚Äôs a great app. Looking forward to using it in the future. Can‚Äôt wait for my next free pizza!

Now every time first of all over 3 time when I entered my card information the app charges my card then tells me something went wrong with the app and I never get my food the employees from 116th and Lexington dominos will ignore your call and tell you your only options is to either reorder and pay again or it is nothing they can do. Second when I order my food takes a long time to come the delivery men are usually nice but most wont even call wen downstairs so sometimes they just take my order back to the store which is annoying after waiting over a hour and a half for your food in the first place then you get the email saying you received and to rate food that never showed up,2020-04-16 17:31:41,Dominos

Fast speedy cooking and delivery.  The drivers really like it if you live in an apartment, that you give instructions of the building you live in and the vicinity of your apartment.  Go the extra mile for them and they will go the extra mile for you, being at your doorstep literally 20 minutes from the time they put it in the oven.

I have a jaw problem that requires me to avoid hard crunchy food or experience the painfully throbbing results. Unfortunately most pizzas delivered from my local store is baked with a dark brown crunchy crust. If this app had an area for simple requests then I would have a record that they would be less apt to ignore & unable to deny that they received. This small improvement could save many customers. I am a frequent patron who is ready to take my substantial orders elsewhere if I don‚Äôt get an effective tool to communicate my needs clearly when ordering.

For the better. Now, I don‚Äôt always eat pizza, because my wife is a great cook of many styles, but when we don‚Äôt have time to cook, or I am on a business trip, like today, I sit back and relax with that slice of happiness again.

I like how the ‚Äònighttime gel capsule‚Äô looking tracker lets me see where my pizza is in the process (or does it look more like a Tide pod?). Anyhow, good stuff Dominos.

I wanted to see a couple of prices so I picked a couple, then it tock me to a donation page. From there it tock me to checkout but still no prices and no way to confirm my order???  That‚Äôs messed up.

Also I was ordering a pizza in a city I don‚Äôt know. I picked the closest Domino‚Äôs and then placed the order BUT once the order is placed, there is no way to see the address anymore to put it into my gps. I had to find the email to get the address. That‚Äôs messed up to.

We love the chicken alfredo but the pasta is just a little too dry for my family if we don‚Äôt order extra sauce on it. Not only does the app not allow me to order extra sauce, there is no where for me to leave a comment on my order to ask for extra sauce that way.

I work in a restraint and take orders 1 minutes before close and they wouldn‚Äôt deliver my food one time with 45 minutes to close. There was no reason for them not to make the order other than pure laziness, and I blame management for letting the employees get away with it.

Why do you have to build it from scratch doesn‚Äôt seem very user-friendly or smart?! Last, what not combined some of the coupons!? We would order so much more pizza if we could combine the coupons!

My father was not sure and was almost about to pay, but remembered me saying that ‚Äúthe app is great because I can use my amex to pay‚Äù. If not for this, my father would have paid twice for the pizzas, creating a headache. Bottom line, it is the staff‚Äôs responsibility to know 100% whether the pizzas have been paid for or not using the app. Having to ask customers is a bit unprofessional.

EDIT:
Domino‚Äôs is the best.

EDIT:
I have not checked up on my complaint above as I don't use that option as much anymore, however now the ""give feedback"" option after you order on the app is broken =( it keeps giving me an error pop up. That's like my favorite part of ordering!! However when you exit out of the original page and re-enter via the tracker button on the home page, it works fine.

I would give this 5 stars (because I love dominoes and you guys are the best!!) but on the iPhone app you have the option for an easy order (which I use frequently).

If I select contactless delivery, there is NO WAY to add a tip for the driver. Don't even pretend you didn't think about this. I've sent feedback about this before, but it just goes to the local store manager who can do nothing about it.

I was a Domino's driver 35 years ago. There was no online ordering then and drivers were generally well tipped. But it's a different world now. People don't keep cash around just for tips. We like to use plastic and be done. By failing to include this simple function in your app, you leave me only two choices ‚Ä¶ get true contactless delivery and stiff the poor driver, or have a normal contact delivery and still have to tip in cash.

2nd, the payment process. Once again, any app that is even trying to keep up ....., and once again, on iPhones, Apple Pay should be one of the payment options.

In this age of scrutiny into business ethics offering a selection of healthier options would be a tremendous venture. Domino‚Äôs ability to change their business in a large ways has been documented in the late 2000s when they campaigned to change from the worst to the best.

This iPhone App was a train wreck from the start.  I was supposed to get 50% off.  $5.99 is  NOT 50% of $8.99.  Who taught you math?  It should be $4.50.  Then order wouldn't go through because it didn't meet their minimum.  Not only do I have trouble eating since my treatment, I can't eat very much.  Can't finish a small pizza.  So, how is this supposed to work.  I ordered a salad, which I cannot eat.  Hoping my wife will eat it.  It cost more than the pizza.  What's up with that?  Very bad experience.

151,Gap Spanner,"Okay, but finicky - and confuses store staff",4,False,"The app works well for most things, but if you make a mistake, it‚Äôs best to cancel everything and start over. And don‚Äôt use the ‚Äòfav order‚Äô feature. Even though you can change things before checkout, sometimes it keeps the old info.

The other issue is more on the employee‚Äôs than the app, but it impacts the app - they don‚Äôt seem very happy with or supportive of the app. They sometimes have difficulty finding the order, and then seem upset that I used it. Sometimes they just have me sign a receipt (I pay via the app), sometimes I don‚Äôt - and some will ask to see the card, ID or both - or none.

I would click the screen and would need to click it a minimum of 10 times, if not more in order for it to allow me to the next page. I also think it would be helpful if the total of your order could be displayed at the top or even possibly the bottom of the app in an effort to keep track of spending instead of having to proceed to checkout to see your order and possibly need to edit it in order to fit within a specific budget. Lastly, it would be helpful if the user were able to provide specific instructions on every item and not just pizza.

With the options given, the stuffed cheesy bread is part of the bundle. When ordering this, it never fails! The price is currently showing on the app at $6.68. I always end up having to call my local store and report which then results in not gained points, to my understanding anyways! This 2 for $5.99 deal needs to be reviewed (all items available for the price) for all customers to ensure that we‚Äôre being charged correctly! Thank you Domino‚Äôs!!",2021-02-03 20:11:14,Dominos

It‚Äôs only marginally better than picking up the phone to call and even at that ‚Äî it‚Äôs simply that you don‚Äôt have to wait on hold and then pay at the store.

Simplify your app and use more limited targeted popups. Users don‚Äôt need to bashed over the head with the same ‚Äúspecial offers‚Äù over and over each time they order.

This could be in the form of a question mark (or something this) on the line where the specialty pizza is listed, that you could tap. Once tapped a small pop up could appear listing the toppings for that specialty pizza.

As it is right now you have to actually go through it like you‚Äôre going to order a pizza, just to see what comes on it. Not very convenient. Anyway, that‚Äôs my 2 cents worth. Keep making hot tasty pizzas for us to enjoy!",2019-10-08 01:27:10,Dominos

We get it staffing is tight but just tell us it is 3 to 4 hrs for delivery and we will adjust or do something different. Now the app doesn‚Äôt appear to allow us to  report an issue either.

187,Depoppy,Great app Need a way to add a tip.,4,False,"This app is extremely easy to use and makes ordering a breeze. 

My only complaint is that there isn‚Äôt a way to add a tip for the driver. We don‚Äôt always have cash on hand and sometimes they don‚Äôt have the receipt or a pen so you can‚Äôt give them a tip. PLEASE ADD AN OPTION TO GIVE A TIP.

Second change would be to change the color of the text to something other then white because it can be pretty difficult to read with the various eye conditions. A larger font and a different color can really make a difference and allow the customer to see everything clearly. Fix those things and I would give you 10 stars.",2022-01-20 01:19:18,Dominos
188,Iher3456678,Horrible App,1,False,"I‚Äôve ordered three times using this app and each time I pay, it said it was an error, and to call the store. The first time I called they said they never got the order so I ordered over the phone. Low and behold, they charged me twice!!! According to the store, in 1-3 business days the extra charge would be returned. The second time same thing, except this time I transferred and had to paid a transfer fee at the bank!!! This last time, we hadn‚Äôt had Dominoes in awhile and forgetting what had happened before placed the order and yet again, error message!!!! This time I called the store and they said they never got my order, so I was done. The manager tried to explain that If you order an odd number of items it does that. WHAT?!?! If I could give no stars I would. My kids were looking forward to it. Oh well.",2020-09-09 22:26:31,Dominos
189,STEVESOP,Good food‚Äîfare prices‚ÄîI will keep ordering,5,False,"Good food‚Äîfare prices‚ÄîA $5 delivery charge that don‚Äôt go to the drivers is nonsense. I understand dominos pays  their delivery drivers $15 an hour which is great . However a billion dollar Company shouldn‚Äôt be profiting on $5 delivery charges that don‚Äôt go to the driver . Making customers offset your expenses so that dominos can have larger profit margins is Horsecrap . I rather the food prices be raised then have a $5 delivery charge. It‚Äôs like going to a gas station and being forced to pay 30 cents a gallon more because they decide to have an attendant. Everyone offers delivery in this modern day and age , very few businesses decide to have these type of tactics .",2019-10-05 21:44:54,Dominos
190,Hooah6,App is great. Pizza...spotty...sorry,5,False,"Really do enjoy the app. I‚Äôd like to see it have a pizza tracking function like Papa John‚Äôs but maybe that is something that is in the works. Our pizza‚Äôs have been very spotty on quality as of late. More times than not, they have arrived luke warm to downright cold. Nothing the microwave cannot cure but it can be a disappointment. ALL of your drivers have been awesome, polite and socially distant. How do you tip them with contactless delivery? They work hard for their money and I‚Äôd like to reward this but if I do not sign a receipt nor face to face contact, how do I tip? Would like to see that added to the app as well.",2020-09-11 21:21:14,Dominos
191,Princess5307,So Many Glitches,1,False,"I was planning on ordering Dominos for dinner and just got fed up with the amount of glitches their app and website had that I ended up ordering Pizza Hut instead. I‚Äôm the type of person who rarely ever leaves bad reviews. I will regularly give a good review, but only leave a bad one if it‚Äôs really, really, bad. 
If you want ranch sauce on your pizza, beware. It will charge you $100. Literally. Some glitch in their system made the upcharge for ranch $100 instead of the $1 or whatever it should be. 
Buttons will randomly not let you click them. For no apparent reason. You want to add that to your order? Too bad. Can‚Äôt click that. 
You want to try to add a coupon? No such luck. If you don‚Äôt add it in the exact way intended, it will glitch on you. 
I have a Masters degree in using technology. This isn‚Äôt a user error. It‚Äôs a poorly coded app.",2021-04-09 22:48:49,Dominos
192,MikeVanderbilt,Has anyone ever complained about getting a burnt pizza from dominos?,5,False,"Excluding the thin crust pizza options, I can‚Äôt think of a time o have received a delivery with my pizza too burnt to eat. It seems to be a growing concern that receive undercooked, inedible pizzas, with the well done option ticked in the cooking instructions.  Tho it has only happened 3 times in the last year, that really shouldn‚Äôt ever happen. 

This was a review of the app, and the app gets 5 stars, y'all have a great app.  But my local dominos is making me wish I had an option for delivery pizza, on the off chance the competitor doesn‚Äôt ship out pizza that is still dough in the middle of the crust. 

Thanks,",2019-03-13 20:24:28,Dominos
193,fbhhfhfhnnthjhthhnn,Great But Not Fully Secure,4,False,"I think this app is great and makes ordering pizza a breeze! The only issue that I discovered is that when I open my app, I‚Äôm not logged in, however I can still place an order and use my card that‚Äôs saved to my account. I set up my cart and was ready to buy. I selected ‚Äúsave this order to my favorites‚Äù or something like that (the easy order option) and the app told me to log in in order to save the easy order. However I was still able to see my card info and make a purchase. I don‚Äôt understand how the easy order access is secure but your payment info isn‚Äôt. Other than that, the app is great.",2020-08-13 03:47:40,Dominos
194,David McEstard,Unfriendly and unreliable,1,False,"You need to be very careful when you are you are using the app. It is highly unfriendly and untrustworthy. While you are supposed to be using a coupon for $5:99 for each pizza, you find out without warning that None (I mean None) of the pizzas you selected was really $5:99 thought you tried to stick to the stupid requirements. A pizza for unexplained reasons will be $10:99 and another $7:99 .... 
You realize then that was a silly game and you decide to pick up the phone and call them after you already wasted your time for that crap. The agent on the phone will honor the coupon (unlike the weird app and online site) and give the exact same pizzas without those skyrocketed prices. 
If you want to save your time, don‚Äôt waste it on that crap (the app and the online). Just call them right away.",2020-05-23 23:55:57,Dominos
195,Mickey on the road,Dominos App,2,False,"First of all Dominos App is Killer on the Road. Ressort for that: When driver prepare order before start driving, and ready to place order 12 minutes before arriving to Dominos store, App suddenly sign out by itself and come into Sign in mode. If driver still want to place order he should drive 70 miles in an hour and time email and long safe password. Most of time he wrongly typed one letter and have start from beginning still driving 70 mil/hour. Wert week bad and danger app. Second: Dominos app can‚Äôt remember sign in information, has not button ‚Äúremember me‚Äù like Papa Johns App and Pizza Hut App. On fhe end Dominos App is way behind Papa John‚Äôs App and Pizza Hut App. Although I am using Dominos App for years, I‚Äôm very disappointed because every time when I try to order pizza I may way from work I put my life in fangs because of such bad App",2019-10-11 21:31:55,Dominos
196,jmark82,Easy Ordering,5,False,"What you see is what you get with Dominos‚Äô app. They make it easy to use coupons, add items and see your total before you purchase. The Pizza Tracker can be hit and miss sometimes but it is helpful to watch where the store is at with building your order. Hungry kids like ours can be a bit more patient before asking ‚Äúwhy isn‚Äôt it here yet?!‚Äù And if they do, I just show the tracker and let them know where the order is in process. Overall, it‚Äôs super convenient and I very rarely call the store anymore unless I forgot to add something or try to make some changes if I messed up (the stores are usually happy to oblige).",2019-02-09 16:25:58,Dominos
197,SavingGrace2018,Domino‚Äôs is Awesome,5,False,"I love the new flavor Dominos has added to their pizza. This has placed them far above the rest. Pizza is my favorite food- so, I know good pizza. This pizza is even awesome the next day! The powerful punch of select seasoning and quality dough makes Dominos superior. I love the company- they are responsive, progressive, customer focused, clean, well managed and a brilliant star overall! Their website is user friendly, easy to navigate, full of great deals, rewards and pizzazz! Dominos has nailed it! No other pizza company can compare. Stars do what stars do....Shine! Shine on Dominos, I‚Äôm behind you 100% If you haven‚Äôt discovered Dominos yet, try them today. I promise, you won‚Äôt regret it!",2018-09-16 19:27:56,Dominos
198,Seabee mom,Good experience and very nice,5,False,"We order from hear about every week for Friday movie night. They are quick and if they do fall behind they are quickly to resolve it in one way or another.  They are priced right in some areas I wish you would get points due to the amount of food you buy not ten points for one order.  Our family loves the new twisted bread parm and cinnamon twist. Pizzas are fantastic, pasta and sandwiches are lovely too. The only down fall is if there is ever an error they like to give us Dr Pepper and we are not Dr Pepper drinkers we are cola and orange drink drinkers... lol. But hey they are sweet and they work hard. Keep up the fantastic works guys and gals.

Best regards

199,2iPads & an iPod Touch owner,Quick and Easy ordering,4,False,"App does what it is designed to do: take orders.  This app is not about deliveries or food quality.  Rather, it is an easy-to-use build-a-pizza and order app.  It remembers all recent orders and you simply hit a ‚Äúreorder‚Äù button to quickly reorder your favorite builds in the future.  Now that i have used the app over several months, it literally takes me 2 minutes to log on, click the version of the pizza we want and move on.  The pizza is at the store for pick up by the time I get there (12 minute drive).  To make matters even better, there is a rewards system.  So, it‚Äôs nice to get a free pizza every now and then (I don‚Äôt keep track of points so it‚Äôs always a happy surprise LOL!)",2018-07-25 15:41:16,Dominos
